"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Really good game with a bad PC launch. Let's hope FromSoftware can fix these performance issues soon because aside from that the game is really good.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,1,"Unfortunately it was a hard pass for me on PC. This is a poor PC port, play it on PS5 if you must. My review is for the technical problems game is facing on PC: Overall 5 out of 10 at this current state on PC.

1. Game locks FPS at 60.
2. Game does not support Ultra Wide - Intentionally (developer actually blocks the ultra wide by drawing black on screen to increase FPS)
3. Game graphics are somewhat worse than Witcher 3 and a bit better than Zelda Breath of Wild.
4. By default it will use Controller mappings even when you do not have controller attached to PC. You may get stuck in settings UI easily.
5. There are frame rate drops in open world on any hardware type
6. There is a 250 ms microstutter in first time enemy encounters.

list goes on and on

if you must play this, give it a try on console. not here. you are warned. Ignoring technical problems aside it is an addictive action game with skill progress. I would not call this story driven RPG. So not this is not Skyrim or Witcher killer. It is a different game all together. Now lets talk about story.

What a lazy guy he became. He basically wrote the story of a game that doesnt really have much of a story? It's a serious question, what exactly he wrote?

I am playing the game on PS5. It is unacceptable on PC right now. It is a good game, with nice combat mechanics and difficulty. Graphics are ""ok"", if you remove the glowing trees, it will be more apparent it is closer to Oblivion quality then Skyrim. It's nothing to write home about. But settings are interesting. I am about 10 hours in so its a bit early but. Just like other soul games, story is not the focus here, if there is one, one can omit it. So i am asking again , what did GRR Martin write exactly? lazy guy who stopped writing GoT and stopped in the middle of war, obviously prefer writing stories for games that actually dont have much stories. Peace out",32,55

- Average performance despite past-gen graphics.
- Lags when loading a new location on its borders.
- Lags in the boss fight in an open air location.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,5,"Maybe too early for review, but just boring, not intriguing. Bigger overhype than CP77. How its possible to get so many possitives before release?

- story 2/10 (fingers, rings, witches, some boring ideas)
- graphics and nice atmospheric lightning 7/10
- menu and shortcuts with keyboard 2/10
- physics and fighting 5/10
- open world i don't feel consistance, reason to go further. Its so chaotic and claustrophobic in design.
- tutorial 2/10 - i hate this text stones.  I dont know why i cannot summon spirits. Ive found after hours how to run and lock target.
- fighting - u die very often but painless. It would be easy when u find weak points, preferred weapon sets and know how to run, but its too old style. Not much physics, cant undecide to do some move. Illogical counter, block, break system or animations. Only left right attack axis. I dont want to enable enemy lock to move backwards. Tps camera lock would be better for me.
-level up system 4/10 (good are small changes between levels but i prefer training level up style than some collecting runes)

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"Terrible controls for PC. Who was in charge of setting up the keybinds? Did they ever play a PC game before in their entire lives? Or did they perhaps use a random letter picker to determine which key should do which action? Who binds ""back/exit"" to Q but not to Esc? Also, why is the lowest sensitivity still spinning my camera like a beyblade? I can't see anything when I ride because my camera is dancing out of control.
This is not a PC issue, but what's up with the dodge? Why would you make the character dodge on button release? It feels wonky and bad. It's not even about getting good at this point, it's just plain annoying when your entire muscle memory is based on dodging on time instead of before.
Not to mention the animations are recycled from DS. There is no ultrawide support. Game stutters in the open world.

I have a gtx 1070 and the game runs much much better than it should tbh.

Unfortunately the game is clunky (even with top hardware), but worse it is just predictable and dull.  Graphics are decent, but not great.  Battles are clunky hack and slash affairs with little enjoyment to be had.  I will say that my dual sense PS5 controller worked decently well with the game.  I didn't give this game a super low rating because it isn't terrible, it just isn't good.  It reminds me quite a bit of the game play in New World, which I also didn't care for, although I think NW was the better of the two games.  I think 4/10 is a fair rating for this one.",29,54

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"(I see that the game has some notable negative reviews. Some are mad and refunding the game. I have three responses:(1) I rage quit Dark Souls back in 2012 after 3 hours of frustrating play. But after putting down the game for a week, clearing my head, and watching guides, I went back to playing what I discovered to be my favorite game series for years. For those initially disappointed, I encourage you to take a break, watch some guides, and try again!(2) If it’s really not for you, that’s perfectly fine! There are great games that I would absolutely refuse to play (Ninja Gaiden series, Nioh etc.) after trying it out a bit, solely because it’s not my type of game. I respect those games nonetheless and would never hate on them just because I don’t like them.(3) If you’re somehow angry at the game for the high critic reviews, I’m glad that From angered the right people: not their long-time fans. As a long-time Souls player, I’m not angry in it in the slightest. Some people overhyped this game to be something it’s not, but it’s what I wanted as a long-time fan of Fromsoftware: an excellent game that pushes the genre to another level while keeping its core identity.It’s not a perfect game by any means. The bugs for many people are horrible, and I hope they’re fixed soon.And though I’m very happy with it, it’s not 100% what I expected from the game. I was hoping for a more majestic open world, and not another decaying, post-fall-of-the-Gods kind of story. The world could be less drab and foggy.But for a guy who impulsively bought Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition 10 years ago and ended up loving the series, I can see that this game was made with a lot of love.More room for improvement means more games. I will eagerly await the next Fromsoftware game. Until then, I’ll happily get lost in The Lands Between for the next few years. It’s a 10/10 for me.",20,38

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"This game is the best game I have ever played...and to be quite frank, the review bombs are unfounded in my opinion. Everyone I have talked too who properly updates their PC has had 0 issues, or only very minor ones, with the game.

If you are on PC.....UPDATE TO THE LATEST DRIVERS. Nvidia released a new driver specifically optimized for Elden Ring last week. You need it. It helps. Do not ignore it.
2nd.....TURN OFF THE STEAM OVERLAY. Steam overlay causes issues with all kinds of games, not just Elden Ring. Just turn the dang thing off and watch your performance improve.  I did both of these things and have had 0 issues with frame rate, stuttering, or anything else that everyone is griping about. It is amazing to me how many PC Gamers don't do the basic maintenance of updating drivers to help their game and PC performance.

The game itself is fantastic. It is the classic Dark Souls combat, mixed with an incredible open world with secrets and items to find EVERYWHERE. Literally their seems to be secrets and things to find on every inch of the massive map. Oh, and Boss fights galore. If you like Fromsoft games, then it is the perfect mesh of all their past games. The lore is great, and while there is a clear cut overarching ""quest"", most of the in-depth lore is still very cryptic and can be discovered through reading item descriptions in true Dark Souls fashion.

I haven't been this into a video games in a lot of years. It ticks all the right boxes, is super addicting, and I find myself thinking about the items, worlds, bosses, and lore even when I am not playing it. It will forever be one of my top 5 gaming experiences, hands down.

So to conclude, ignore the review bombers, update your PC, and enjoy one of the greatest games in recent memory. You will not regret it.",20,39

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"its amazing. This game is basically open world with the dark souls/bloodborne formula. For souls fans this is amazing. For new players, not so much. There isnt a lot of innovative design etc as other people are saying, but why innovate when it aint needed? The PC port itself is bad, the game is amazing. If you can, play it on console, but if you have a high end PC like myself you will have a blast. Im talking 3090 high end PC, the framrate is locked, but thats easy to circumvent with a mod, same with EAC. I honestly dont care about the technical challenges as they are easy to solve, annoying, but easy to solve.

This is pathetic. This is not good combat design. This is awful. Unless you love to just endlessly run away and feel how pathetic you are, maybe you gonna love this combat, but i like games where you can actually truly fight back or have cool battles.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,4,"I've got the very latest drivers and Elden Ring has also received a small patch (which was supposed to target the frame-rate issues) that hasn't fixed the main problem.
4/10",30,63
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,3,"Tagline : ""Most overrated Runescape clone, hyped up by people who hate the fact that GTA and Assassin's Creed are popular""

What specs you need to run it 60fps - 1080p or 4K, without stutter or lag?
- Honest answer is that, no matter how good your PC is, no matter, if you have PS5, this game will perform horribly and only thing you can do is wait for multiple patches.

This game goes into same category of games, that have been extremely overhyped and extremely underdelivered. Other examples would be ""Cyberpunk 2077"", ""Fallout 76"", ""Anthem"", ""Battlefield 2042"" and ""Elden Ring"" is another fine addition to that list.

So what new groundbreaking mechanics, graphics, open world design, innovative combat or interesting story this game offers? - Pretty much none of these.

Graphically (for some weird reason) this game goes back to 2012/2013. But 2012/2013 had lots of great games and at times ""Elden Ring"" even looks beautiful, especially the sky, but ground and grass textures are pretty much worse than some 2013 games. For 2022 AAA release this is bad. Game that gets Metascores 95/97 in 2022, should have way more work put into it.

Next up is open world design - There's extreme amount of boring looking, absolutely empty areas. This is automatically bad open world design, because these empty areas, that doesn't even look good have zero purpose to be there. Other areas that actually have something, okay let's make that clear, all that other areas have is trees and monsters. Endless amount of monsters that are simply sitting there, doing nothing, waiting for you to slay them. This is literally Runescape game design 101, i have been playing Runescape since 2004, i know what i'm talking about.

Quests (if you can even call them) are extremely short, boring and you can literally ignore all of them. It's usually some lady asking you to go somewhere, get something, get it back to her. Most hilarious thing is that game doesn't show that you have completed any of them, which basically means that by the end of the game, you forget that you even did these. Runescape has more complex lore, quests and writing than this game can only dream of. Why i'm talking about Runescape and not Skyrim, you might ask - Well because lore wise, Skyrim would be too tough challenger for this game.

Combat is extremely similar to Dark Souls 3, game that released 6 years ago. Same animations, same everything. Anyone who says in that case that ""Innovation is overrated"" has no right to criticize Rockstar or Ubisoft ever again, just saying.

Anyone who says that having horse is innovative must be a troll, because having this empty open world without any transportation, would be almost insulting.

All in all very weak release, only fun i had in this whole game were two boss fights - Margit and Godrick, i have to say they have extremely unfair combos, attacks and they are pointlessly difficult to beat, especially for 2 first bosses, but at least they have some interesting lore and cool monster design.

1 point for beautiful sky design, 1 point for Margit boss design and 1 point for Godrick boss design.

Overall score 3/10 - Not recommending, unless you have never played open world game before, but even then, you just could play older open world games that are way better.",39,82

I also don't understand why everyone is defending the game. Fact is: The game is pretty broken at the moment.

Graphics? Are we back in 2013? Is this game supposed to represent games from early 2010s? I'm really, really confused, because i haven't seen so bad grass movement/placement since 2012/2013. I think even Assasin's Creed 4 (2013) had better looking grass. Sky actually looks beautiful, so i'm assuming ground and sky had completely different designers? But whoever decided that combining these two into one game was ok, should maybe look for some other job.
Just saying.

World feels absolutely lifeless. I was free roaming for hours (10+ hours), killing every enemy i met and more i went on, more i discovered how lifeless this whole world is. All enemies are just conveniently placed all over the map and they are simply waiting for you to go and kill them. They hardly move, they hardly do anything tbf.

I really, really tried to like it. I wouldn't spend 10+ hours in a game, that i don't care about. Atmosphere was there, bad graphics were distracting, but it was tolerable, because at times it looks very beautiful. Castles actually look very cool, but they are not as detailed as i would expect AAA 2022 game to be.

If only reason you play this game is killing one boss after another, good for you. I was expecting actual 2022 AAA video game, because hardly any game gets metascore 95 and in my opinion, it's not even slightly justified and i'm extremely disappointed.",73,162

I was dying to get the horse, because moving around was so slow and boring. But when i finally got the horse, it didn't help much, world was still boring.

"Mar 15, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,7,"TLDR: Open world DS3 with a few minor additions.

Full disclosure: I have not completed Elden Ring and don't plan to for now. I bought into the hype and regret dropping full price on this game so I'm hoping my review might help those still on the fence about buying this game. I have beaten Demons Souls, Darks Souls 1, 2, Bloodborne and currently 75% through Dark Souls 3 (which I do plan on finishing) so I do have experience with prior Fromsoft games and have enjoyed them. The technical issues with the PC port have already been covered ad nauseum so I'll go over some of the other aspects of the game.

Gameplay:
Basically the same as Dark Souls 3 with a few minor changes: 1) addition of jump button, 2) addition of mount and very basic mounted combat, 3) addition of guard cancel, 4) weapon arts are now equippable (""ashes of war"" in Elden Ring). Veterans of the Souls series will feel right at home whereas the slower, calculated and methodical style of combat may take some getting used to for newcomers. Button mashing will get you killed very quickly in this game and even trash mobs can tear you apart.

What was once revolutionary and spawned the whole subgenre of ""Soulslike"" games has become stale, predictable, and formulaic. Most of the enemies are reskins from the prior entries and in some cases, reused assets (eg. the giant crabs). Yes, the game is punishingly difficult but much of that difficulty is artificial from things like janky camera angles concealing environmental hazards, gank squads in tight quarters, enemy projectiles defying the laws of physics, etc. Bosses attack relentlessly and you'll find yourself dodging for what feels like an eternity for a safe opportunity to counterattack, only to deal like 2% of their health. You'll likely die to greed, trying to get some more hits in on the boss because you're so bored of doing nothing but dodging yet another unending combo.

For fans of the Souls series, this may be everything you wanted and for newcomers, this may still be fresh and exciting. For those who've played the Souls series and were hoping for some fresh gameplay, you won't find it here.

World Design:
The biggest change in Elden Ring from the Souls series is the introduction of an open world. For many, this is a breath of fresh air and one of their favourite features of Elden Ring. The world is massive and you can easily spend hours just exploring, opening up many possibilities for non-linear progression. Unfortunately for me, once I got passed the initial beauty of the world, I found it to be mostly empty and lifeless, and I found spending hours riding around on my mount looking for things to do tedious and boring. You will encounter random enemy mobs scattered throughout but the reward for killing them wasn't worth the effort so I just started riding around them. The optional dungeons I explored felt pointless, akin to the Chalice dungeons in Bloodborne.

If you follow the recommended path through the game, you will likely be severely underleveled for the first main boss so exploration of optional content is clearly encouraged by design. Sadly, I don't find the exploration in Elden Ring to be interesting enough for the time investment required and this is the main reason why I don't plan on finishing Elden Ring, while I do plan on finishing DS3. However, many people love the aspect of exploration and discovery in Elden Ring so you may have a very different experience from me.

Story:
Like all the prior Souls titles, the story of Elden Ring is told cryptically in fragments mainly from NPC dialogue and item descriptions. George RR Martin was involved in the writing which I never would have guessed since the lore seems to basically be a reskin of the prior Souls titles. There are 1:1 equivalents for almost everything. The Elden Ring = First flame, Tarnished = chosen undead/ashen one, Site of Grace = Bonfire, Crimson Flask = Estus flask etc. Souls games have always required multiple playthroughs to unlock all the different endings and different NPC questlines to piece together the lore. The lore is often rich and interesting but I frankly don't have the time to go through the effort and will be watching some youtube lore videos to experience the story.

Some people love this mysterious style of narrative and I enjoyed it with the prior Souls games as well. However, it really is just feeling like more of the same at this point and even the basic premise is similar to the prior games and I guess I was hoping for something fresh.

Overall:
Elden Ring is a very good game but isn't for everyone. Fans of the Souls series who just wanted more of the same will enjoy this and newcomers who don't mind the challenge will likely get sucked in as well. However, for players like me who enjoyed the Souls games but were expecting something new, Elden Ring falls shorts. Maybe I just don't like open world games? 7/10.",6,6

"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,7,"PC issues aside, the game isn’t that polished. There are real head-scratching oversights in this game that make me wonder how anyone can try touting this as the best RPG of recent memory.

Unfortunately, the ever-toxic Souls community is clouding a pretty good game.

I will say, what keeps me coming back, like any player, is that addictive style the Souls games are famous for. Little by little you get better, learn more, and then get destroyed by a boss. If you have an addictive personality or short temper, it’s probably better not to even start this.",3,3

"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,7,"Wonderful, beautiful game that struggles on all things fine tuning. A 7.9 that never quite reached an 8 for me. Love fromsoftware but while the aesthetic, bosses, and npcs of the game's world shine things like camera controls, jumping, and sprint mechanics feel clunky, you never know when you're gonna get stuck on a tiny rock divet / indestructible twig that prevents your movement and it WILL happen / cause you to get killed. Basically, you need luck to be on your side in a game that is trying to reward skill-based patient rpg gameplay.

Things like level progression mid game, item progression, and game direction have their own clunkiness, trying to play the game without reading 5 tabs first on a second monitor will lead to boring sessions. Often you'll go through a difficult area only to find some semi-useful item within a build path completely opposite your own, and while getting through the area is satisfying in itself it ends up not feeling like it builds towards anything significant. Later in the game, these boss enemies get heavily recycled and upscaled, making the original satisfaction dim, and leaving a certain apathy toward future side areas.

As far as the good of the game, the world IS huge AND beautiful, and you will have moments where you feel extremely badass. Though the stats screen is awful and cannot show comparisons of armor / items side by side, the armor itself is varied with all kinds of cosmetic looks. Weapons/Spells/Ashes all have a range and truly give a dnd type experience where the player can get custom as hell. Without spoilers, there is an area where the player can re-assign stats for a cost, which is a much needed feature that allows all types of mid life crisis.

Ultimately (and this is speaking to my OWN experience), the bottom line was that after a certain point of exploring the beautiful map most of the time in this game just wasnt fun. I was either looking for fun in world, looking up fun online, or grinding mob filled rooms to get fun parts, all while carrying that passive fromsoftware 'die whenever wherever' game stress that does give some satisfaction to the experience. After trying a couple of different builds I found that typically there's way more fun to be had in completely overhauling a build every so often than in steadily carrying a build through the game. And that speaks to my opinion of the game. Most of the thrill is all the new things, the novelty, the possibilities, but once you've seen 50% of the enemies, explored what you want, and committed to a build path, you're in for a boring time grinding from boss to boss.",1,1
"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,5,"I honestly don't understand why people are writing raving reviews for this game.

Let's start with the good before we move on to the bad and the horrendous that is ""Elden Ring""

- Gorgeous (bosses, world, art, etc.)
- Huge
- Mounted Combat (Casting is way better than the sword play though)
- The game plays well
- Lots of armors and weapons, that are cosmetically cool
- Sound design is really good

Now the bad

- Hyper aggressive Mobs that 2-3 shot you
- Bend Curve for Stat Effectiveness but a Doubling Curve for monster health and difficulty, making end game extremely tedious and repetitive. Your char will shine midgame, but after that your increase in damage and survivability flatlines, while monster health triples.
- Repetitive
- Many, Many places, dungeons, etc. in the world are reused.
- Depth of Field is confusing, the camera doesn't really have optimal rotation, you will often plunge to your death, and after you have you have to backtrack to your corpse, and hope that this time around you don't miss the jump, and if you do, lose all your runes... I mean... uff exhausting
- The platforming and death from falling is absolutely horrendous.
- Backtracking
- The Combat just sucks, I'm sorry. It's fun in the first halve of the game, but when fights start to drag out to 5 minutes per normal mob up to 10-15 sometimes 20 minute boss fights that you have to restart if you make a few bad dodges, it just get's tedious. Not to mention you'll be using the same spells/combat arts most of the time, so it get's extremely tedious and repetitive.
- Best way to play a lot of the game is just by running past and skipping everything.
- Most spells suck.
- Questlines are confusing at best, there's nothing to guide you to understand what the game expects of you, and sometimes if you missed a part of the quest and progressed too far, the quest dies.
- Bugs.
- Balance is ****

This game is overhyped, and the user score reflects that.
I would honestly stop trusting any critic reviews, they have no idea what they are talking about, and are most likely hyping the game for a paycheck

I would avoid this game for a few more months, if not year, and grab it on a sale. It has some esthetic, and you'll get some fun out of it, and it will at points frustrate the **** out of you with poor gameplay design.

I guess fun if you are a sadomasochist.",1,1
"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Absolutely fantastic! Hours and hours of quality entertainment! And unlike certain other triple A games just released, no microtransactions!",1,1
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,5,"- Formulaic storytelling that feels extremely derivative. It was acceptable to a point with the previous titles, but with Elden Ring, it feels like it's gone past that and now it just feels cheap and lazy.
- This game is a galore of reused assets, animations, and everything in between. There seems to be very little to this game that's wholly unique; almost everything you see has been ripped shamelessly from Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne and changed slightly (if even that).
- No benefit to the addition of an open world. It serves no purpose to enrich the gameplay and in fact hurts the game as FromSoftware has had great level design in past games which can't be accomplished as well with an open world game. Furthermore, the world feels extremely empty and dead as there are ridiculously vast amounts of lands filled with nothing.
- Crafting adds unnecessary bloat to a game that doesn't really need it and mounted combat trivializes the vast majority of fights, which is probably because the overworked developers didn't have time to design any of the fights against it.

In conclusion, Elden Ring proves that FromSoftware is no longer the innovative game developer from a few years ago that was afraid to take risks and give us something fresh and new. Elden Ring is an exact, formulaic repeat of every Souls game that came after Dark Souls 2 that feels mediocre at best. This isn't Elden Ring, this is Souls 2K22.",11,13
"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,6,"Not a terrible game, but has a lot of issues.

The PC port is one of the worst of all time. There is no proper keyboard and mouse support, there are random locked keybindings for menu navigation. All the prompts are using controller buttons. A lot of people report stuttering and crashes.

The game looks at least 5 years dated if not 10 years. Poor animations as if I'm playing ""Risen"" or something. And the performance is similarly not in line with its looks. Comparing it to the recent Sony ports for example is like night and day. Games like HZD or God of War really showcases how little effort Elden Ring devs put in towards making the game look good and run well on PC.

The open world aspect of the game suffers from issues that plague most open world games. There's a lot to explore and a lot of stuff to find but most of it is meaningless filler. 90% of the loot you find does not feel rewarding for the time and effort you invest into finding it.

The story and narrative is a mess. It's as if someone wrote a book and then put all the pages through a randomizer. There's some kind of a story, but it's basically intentionally vague and confusing so that you wouldn't even bother trying to understand it and would simply go and fight monsters.

And as for the fighting - enemy AI is dumber than dirt, as if often the case with fantasy games. When it comes to creating non-human enemies, developers default to ""they see you and they will chase you"" coding. That's all there is. No tactics, no nothing.

Bosses are fun to fight, but at the end of the day, they all boil down to the exact same thing. You learn their limited move set and then you can beat them to death with a club while being butt naked and not even taking a single point of damage. There are no crazy tactics and cool strategies to beat bosses.

You can pretty much run through the whole game naked and weaponless if you could memorize every boss mechanic.

Personally, I find that it takes out a lot of incentive to explore and try to improve your character, because even with good gear, a lot of the bosses still have moves that decimate you. So no matter what, you still kinda have to learn how to beat them. So more gear and xp just makes enemies faster to kill. Which is different from a lot of other games where you kinda have to level and gear up because the enemies are literally not possible to beat otherwise.

The developers also clearly ran out of ideas a quarter of the way through the game. As whole areas and boss fights end up being copy-pasted and refurbished. The scenery might change a little, the enemies might be differently coloured, but they're same as before.

This again isn't new to most open world games, but it does add more evidence to why Elden Ring doesn't really do much anything that's ""next gen"" or creative.

All in all, I would recommend most people to check out the game, if only to be aware of what's one of the most hyped up games of all time. But get ready to refund the game, because odds are, you will not be particularly impressed by it. If the game even runs on your PC at all.

I got my copy refunded on Steam without issue, so do make use of their generous refund policy to demo out the game.",11,13

Veteran Dark Souls player here and a longtime fan of Fromsoft games. I thought that I was going to love this game and that it would occupy my time for many months. I was wrong.

The joys of traversing and exploring the open world get old very fast. I was bored of it after only a few days. It takes forever to accomplish anything. Essential items are scattered across this massive map and it's such a slog to travel around and collect everything. I really miss the linear level design of Dark Souls. And for what it's worth, I loved Breath of the Wild and Assassin's Creed Valhalla. I am not a stranger to open world games but an open world version of Dark Souls just didn't do it for me.

I made it to quite late in the game. I was only a couple hours of gameplay away from the final boss battle.  Eventually it just hit me like a train and I told myself that I don't want to do this anymore. I just don't.

And no it's not a ""git good"" problem, I've finished all dark souls games and sekiro, it's an optimization problem and Fromsoft clearly not giving a **** about pc gamers. The only 2 games where my pc started farting furiously as soon as they loaded are cyberpunk 2077 and elden ring and if you've heard anything about cyberpunk that alone says a lot. Even with all options turned down to the lowest possible I get 20-40 fps on 1080p in open world and these drop even more on boss fights. Not to mention the occasional stuttering which sometimes turns into death warrant. It's shameful asking full price for a game at this state and even releasing it at this state in the first place. Have we all just accepted that we'll be beta testing games from now on?",9,11
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,5,"Where do I begin on this title and the insanely inflated hype around it? Elden Ring is yet another entry to the Souls genre, and this time steps away from the tried and true design of tightly crafted game worlds that Fromsoft usually brings us. Unfortunately, we are left with a bland and lifeless Overworld, connected with obscured dungeons that feel copied straight from Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons. There was something missed in translation here, as most open worlds draw you in with a plethora of things to experience, not just empty space between the next thing to kill.
Speaking of killing, the entire game revolves around removing enemies out of your way. This is the same as every Souls game, but this is supposed to be an open world experience. Imagine just laying a linear game out on top of a big map and calling it ""open world"" now. With nothing else to do, you will be traveling across large, empty expanses to find another repetitive dungeon, another rehashed enemy, another reskinned boss...with rewards that do not give you incentive to explore. You hit walls where you cannot pass, so you must go try a different route until you are strong enough to do the ""intended"" route. You will begin to lose steam after the honeymoon phase wears off.

The bosses get progressively more ridiculous as you move through the game. Instead of opting for a dance of combat like Bloodborne or Sekiro, you will spend the entire battle rolling around, counting on iframes to help scrape you out of a 9-hit combo alive, where each hit of the combo can chunk you for most of your health. Enemies everywhere rely on delay attacks, holding their weapons in the air just until you finish rolling for a cheap kill. Some will defy physics and spin midair to land on you. The whole thing is about being cheesed by enemies or cheesing them by leveling. Even having the strongest physical defense armor in the entire game, plus dumping most of your points into Vigor, you will still be 2 shot by end bosses. Highly disappointing.

The ""open world"" is rife with shambling creatures that walk in circles or wait patiently for you to approach and dispatch them.  NPC stand around, lifeless in this uninspired world. You cannot track any quests, so unless you have a really good memory, you are expected to play with a journal by your side for notes. The UI used is ugly and over a decade old. Movement is nearly a direct copy from Dark Souls 3, with weapon Arts.

The biggest crime here, though, is the reviews from Critics. Unanimously overflowing 10/10 review from nearly every gaming company out there. For a continuation of pretty niche type of game, the how is unreal. Especially when NOTHING here is revolutionary, inventive, or deserving of the word ""masterpiece."" At best it is bait to get people to buy Elden Ring, only to be highly disappointed after the refund return window has closed.

Also, the hype of George RR Martin to sell the game! This is just using a name to sell your product. You can replace entire words with phrases from Dark Souls. Site of Lost Grace = Bonfire. The Chosen Undead = Tarnished. Etc. The story is rehashed Dark Souls, not some new epic tale.

The PC version is in a whole worse state than just these issues, as well. Frame rate drops, stuttering, lack of good controls, and losing connection are just some of the problems that weigh this version down even farther. The day one patch made it worse, not better.

Make sure you do your research. Look up USER reviews, since the critic market is flooded with inflated reviews from gushing fans. Watch gameplay videos and look through reddit posts for the truth. You have to wade through the stinky swamp of mainstream hype to find the glowing thread of truth in this madness. But you want more Dark Souls, spread out over a really big map, give it a try.",12,15

I somehow get back to my character, and try to figure out what ""R"" means.
I press R, drink something, then nothing.
I begin to understand that the tips on the screen are not for me, a classic PC player with good old keyboard and mouse.
I manage to push through tutorial, find how to jump and do other actions by several times going to the keyboard shortcuts.
Then I'm asked to wield with both hands with a combination that is not present in the keyboard shortcuts, I had to go search online how to do that.
Then I'm asked to do some other special attack on the poor undead fella.
I try something, it looks like a regular ""power attack"", so I have no idea if that's what the ""tutorial"" was talking about, but the fella is dead now, and I don't know if I'll ever see a tutorial on how to perform this special attack again.
I move on, another attack with undecipherable keys that are simply just not present on my setup.
I do not even have a controller configured on my PC...
Keys assignments are terrible, tutorial is terrible.
It just made me want to stop playing. It was painful. I'm not supposed to feel pain from figuring out how to translate console messages to PC world for a game released for PC.
Edit: before sending the review, I went back to explore the full content of options, and yes, you CAN set the screen tutorials to display the keyboard&amp;mouse version.
Why was the game setup with controller by default even when I have no controller at all is a mystery to me, but it definitely ruined my inital contact with the game, feeling unwelcome, a relic from the past that had to ""move on"" to controllers.
I'm not saying that's the intent, I'm just saying that's how I felt.
I understood nothing at all the intro scenes, except there are gazillons of names and concepts being thrown at you that make absolutely no sense.
I usually LOVE slow pace narrative, but this is just SLOW to make it look epic, but there is nothing epic about it.
You land in the world with a character assigned to a class that tells you nothing about it.
It really feels like different teams designing different elements of the game and no one was ever in charge of making sense of the whole package, the user experience.

Some enemies are just too fast and in a battle with few enemies, you quickly find yourself without orientation, slaughtered by monsters.

I started as a Hero and STR Build, I'm adapting to STR+DEX and I should put some points in INT and MND too.

I'm ok with having hard enemies and dying a lot, but then after practice getting better and beating enemies, but there are some really weird and unhelpful design decisions taken in this game which make it really tedious and irritating.

For one it takes about 30-40 seconds to reload the game once you die. This is on my pretty beefy PC and you die a LOT! Also it starts without any kind of map system, and other game systems which it just does not explain.

The open world is just crap. There is no ""life"" there and enemies and NPC's are always in the same place, not moving at all. Even GTA 3 had more life that this game. So basically it's just a really large open space when you have to go from attack to attack.

A questão aqui é que o jogo não apresenta na MINHA opinião, nenhuma grande inovação no mundo dos jogos. Ele tem uma exploração cansativa, que não é motivante, muitas das vezes não te da nenhum item que tu realmente fique feliz em ter pego, os inimigos repetidos a todo canto e com move set ou aparência reciclados faz com que eu sinta estar jogando os mesmos jogos que foram lançados já fazem 11 anos. Ter bosses diferentes, ou bem detalhados EU não considero grandes pontos positivos, pois isso é o básico, falar que esse jogo a vale o que é cobrado pra mim é piada, 97 de nota é piada, não adianta de nada ter uma baita história genial, contada de uma maneira ""inovadora"" se a gameplay durante as 60 horas de jogo vão ser enjoativas. Sem falar que a história é mais do mesmo, esse jogo se resume a preguiça.

Unfortunately the game is held back by its technical limitations. I think there would be a lot less complaints about the graphics if the performance was good, but it isn't.

It's not a game for everyone, after all, it's still a Soulslike game and anyone expecting something different will be disappointed.
The difficulty is interesting offering good challenges.
The game's content is undeniably AWESOME, however its PC optimization is awful! There are several moments where I would say I'm unplayable with absurd frame rate drops.
THEY NEED to improve the optimization and, if possible, make the game more accessible to computers with lower performance so that the game content is properly used.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,6,"It's a good game and a decent open world attempt, but it's completely ruined by a horrible, poor, lazy and inexcusable port that made me regret spending 80 euro for it.

The setting is intriguing, but while some enemies are cool and interesting, many are just unimaginative, extremely repetitive and boring, e.g. undead with lance, undead with sword&amp;shield, undead with axe, etc.

Graphics is previous generation and the performance are abysmal with frame rate drops, stuttering and freezes.

Sound effects are fine while music ranges from average to good; I bought the deluxe edition to get the 67 soundtracks but honestly I can't remember a single track I'd like to listen to again...disappointing.

UI is made fro consoles... it's old, lazy and awful to use with mouse&amp;keyboard.
You can't use your mouse to interact with it.
It is inconsistent, sometimes you use Enter other E, sometimes Esc others Q...who decided to waste one of the most comfortable button (Q) to use it just for closing a menu!?
You open a menu with a button but you can't close it with the same button, you have to move you hand and reach another uncomfortable one. Why? Who knows...
You can't rebind many controls, so you're stuck with a poor layout.

You can add markers on the map but there are less than 10 icons and you can't add text, a very poor and lazy system.
When you mouse over a location the tooltip doesn't pop out, you have to move a target icon with WASD over the location.

When buying items you can't compare stats with what you're using...I have no words for this...it's just pathetic for a 2022 AAA 80 euro game...pathetic.
While you can accept quests from the very few NPCs you find around, there is no quest log to remind you of anything you're supposed to do.
In order to quit you have to open a menu, select an option, switch to the right window, select quit, return to the title screen, watch the titles, press any key, scroll the menu, select quit again...tedious.

Controls are crap, some of them you can change others not and the default layout makes you think that whoever made it has never played a PC game before.
To use quick items you have to hold E and press the Arrows letting the mouse go...instead of simply pushing comfortable buttons like 1-5 or QERFTGZXCV.
Sprint and dodge are on the same button instead of Shift and At, this will lead to often dodgeroll instead of sprinting or you having to release the sprint and push it again in order to dodgeroll.
You have to manually select Mouse&amp;Keyboard prompts inside the Audio Menu (why!?), otherwise the game shows you XBox Controller shortcuts, even though you don't have a controller.
It records commands while you're character is stuck in an animation and when the animations ends it fires them one after another...
Can't climb which has become a standard in many Open World games.
The trailers let you believe you get a flying horse of some sort, but the reality is that there are only a bunch of jumping pads positioned here and there.

Camera is terrible and when you turn it, it keeps trembling and stuttering cause the script is fighting your command trying to constantly reposition the camera and giving you headache; sometimes it goes completely crazy and keeps turning in circles for no reason.

AI sometimes is good others poor, for instance enemies can see you trough walls and attack you without checking the line of sight, e.g. archers keep firing at you even though you're are behind a wall.

Combat doesn't have fixed rules, they keep changing so they can kill you easily.
Some enemies get staggered when you hit them or block their attacks, others don't, and keep hitting you like nothing happened.
Sometimes you can avoid a frontal attack by dodging towards the side or the back of an enemy, others the enemy while already in an attack animation, suddenly performs a 360° turn and hits you anyway.
Projectiles like arrows, bolts, ballista shots, etc are guided missiles that turns midair following and hitting you even if you've moved sideways or dodged them.
If while attacking your weapon hits a wall you get staggered, but when and enemy does it nothing happens, theirs animation isn't interrupted like yours.
Spells are completely unbalanced and 95% of them are useless cause they deal much less damage then the basic one, making you think they didn't even test this game properly.
They said you could play as an archer, but you simply can't cause you have to craft arrows and in order to do that you have to grind materials wasting more arrows, not
to mention that sometimes you're going to die for hours while fighting a boss, which means you're going to waste thousand of arrows.
A simple solution would have been letting you craft quivers with infinite arrows and enchant them to cast fire/poison/magic arrows, etc. Too complicated for these devs I guess.

As I said, it's a horrible, poor, lazy and inexcusable port.",13,20

Combat is slow to the point of being almost turn based, boring, and way too easy. Most bosses are first try. it feels more like a circus than a fight. You see the same enemies and bosses over and over. Very lazy. Animations are silly and sometimes just ridiculous. Weapons and armor looks stupid. Lock on system is trash. Camera sucks. Status effects go through shields. Lol why?

Bad FPS stutters

No story whatsoever.

Terrible multiplayer and netcode. Co-op keeps dropping. PvP is laggy.

Engine feels like its from 2005

Crashes and locks up.

Glitches happen often.

Soundtrack is boring, uninspired, and generic. Re-used sounds.

Re-used animations (all the way from DS1)

Mouths dont sync with dialogue or most of the time, move at all lol.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"FEEL - Could be the best game I have ever played - never played dark souls and just started sekiro a week before elden ring release- so im learning and it is an incredible experience.  Around 20 hours in, the closest I have ever felt to this was in the 3rd grade when mario64 came out and I couldnt put it down, it was just so unbelievable to me at the time, and that is how elden ring feels to me now.

WORLD/DESIGNS/COMPARISONS - morrowind, oblivion, skyrim, witcher 3 have all been incredible games of a similar type that ive played and elden ring is in its own tier above them and unbelievable in comparison - the combat and in game systems are incredible, the open world is the best open world experience I have ever had - the scale, the secrets, the detail, the art style, the adventure and exploration.... you can tell this world is handcrafted.  The level design in the first legacy dungeon is the best level i have ever seen in a game (verticality, hidden secrets, aesthetics, scale, enemies, stealth). The lack of in game systems to aid players is one of my favorite aspects - you have to learn on your own, I am very much a self learner though.

OPTIMIZATION/PERFORMANCE/CONTROLS - I spent some time optimizing my PC beforehand - tweaking various setting in windows/nvidia/mouse cpi and in game controls (mouse sensitivity after first patch) to make sure I would run it fine.  I could use my controller and it might be more intuitive than the mouse keyboard, but honestly ive gotten used to the mouse and keyboard and it feels fine.  I'm playing in the high graphics setting and FPS is 57-60.  I don't really notice any issues with the prep I did beforehand.  Graphics are breathtaking and beautiful, the ray tracing is amazing.  Also of note - I have not experienced any noticeable bugs in the game - it already feels very polished to me.
If you understand PC's and know how to change settings on your PC and not just in game, or are capable of learning how to and are above minimum requirements to play the game, I don't see how you could not achieve desirable performance running the game.

CHARACTER - im not typically a spell caster in rpg games i typically go ranger types, but here i went astrologer and magic is incredibly fun! although I cant wait to play numerous others character builds at some point - the customization feels like a sandbox.

ALL in all, this game isnt for everyone - but if you are ready in your life for a true adventure and put the effort and time forward to learn and explore - it will give you the time of your life.",8,13

What I did to change is this:

In-Game:
I turned all of these to either off or to the lowest I could get. (Thanks to na1s in another review)
- Depth of Field
- Motion Blur
- Volumetric Quality
- Global Illumination Quality
- Grass Quality

Out of Game:
(Thanks to GeeSung for putting all of these in a review.)
Exit the game. Go to your windows bar and search ""graphics"". Click on ""Graphics Settings"". Choose the desktop app and click ""browse"". Search through your drive for the EldenRing.exe and set the options to ""High performance"". Start the game.

For increased frame rate: just set the global ""Shader Cache Size"" setting in NVIDIA Control Panel to ""Unlimited"": https://i.imgur.com/wm4y2GU.jpeg -credit u/bobasaurus

There are so many mysteries to solve and of course epic bossfights with legendary loot. They said 80 hours to complete the game, but after 35 hours i'm still far away from an end. I love games where you need to work for your victorys. Enjoy the journey!",11,18
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"this game is a masterpiece. If you like souls games, you are going to LOVE this!That being said, if you DON’T like souls games, there’s a chance you may not like this. There is no journal, your compass isn’t flooded with random markers. You just explore. Every direction you go in will have something unique and interesting. The story is not shoved down your throat, but unlike other souls games you do not have to go looking for it. The game does a good job of explaining story elements as you go along.The combat is amazing, including the horse combat. While the horse combat is very simple, it feels good. Fighting dragons on horseback is epic and feels amazing.I play on a 1650 and have had next to no issues. However I know a lot of other people have had serious performance issues.",11,18
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,Almost every single bad review is complaining about performance. That can be fixed. Most of these reviewers that are giving negative reviews are expecting the game to run on their potato machines. The game definitely needs optimization but it's definitely playable. Game is amazing.,14,23

It's all downhill from now.Elden ring is, with the lack of a better word, a masterpiece.Don't play it if you like skyrim, button mash and hack-and-slash games. This game is harder than you can probably handle.The game also does not hold your hand, at all.It's your adventure and your own path into becoming an Elden lord.",14,23

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"What an experience! I expected much, but got even more than I could ever hope for.
The world of Elden Ring is simply beautiful - it's harsh and unforgiving, but exploring it is the most fun I've had in months. Is it perfect? No, but nothing really is. The things that I would improve are very minor things like some hiccups with coop disconnects (understandable now that everyone's playing it) that I can easily overlook in favor of how amazing the music is, the graphics, the combat gameplay, the boss design, the story.......I loved every second of it!",12,20
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"As a FromSoft fan, I had to play this game on release day, and it's been so hard to put down!!
I actually LOVE that it's become more accessible, with more safe spots before bosses for example.

The exploration of the open world is addictive, I could run around for hours just gathering! You wouldn't believe how many little secrets you can find, there's just sooo much stuff!

Graphics are stunning, especially in the environment, and the boss animations are truly another level above DS3 or Sekiro. I think this game had more repeatability than any Souls game, and I will probably be playing this for years...",12,20

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"I find it hilarious tht I am forced to give a 10/10 to a game tht I havent even finished because of the reviewbombing of ppl tht did not also finish the game, tht dont even own the game and are salty because a game genre they dont like is being successful, and performance issues malders. Performance isnt good but its not unplayable to the point of giving a game 0. Funny how for one time in your life you should actually listen to some game journos and not the community which is appalling. This is like the situation where italians would reviewbomb games a 0 because they didnt have italian dubs. My thoughts having 12hours in and defeating the first two main bosses are tht the story seems pretty interesting like any other souls game, the combat when the game runs smoothly is really great especially with the new weapon arts, open world is somewhat empty... and thts someone who hasnt played the game would tell you. I dont want to spoil the open world but there is a lot to uncover in it trust me. Bosses are AMAZING. World design is great graphics arent tht good just a bit of a step up from ds3 and the performance isnt good. When you load into areas the frame does drop in pretty much every pc which is smthing tht needs a fix. If you like any souls game you should absolutely get this one. Let the haters, which unfortunately exist for this game, cope harder and just enjoy yourself its a really good game so far.",9,15

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"It's fine. I'd like to see less open world and more dungeons. Give me a big sprawling dungeon, or an open world undead parish with multiple routes. Also some of the bosses are incredibly unfair/based off of new gimmicks (mainly riding) and leveling, rather than skill.  YOU spend the eight hours beating Ulcerated Tree Spirit without leveling, potentially the second boss you can run into. The first fight is also like ten times harder than Vangard Demon in DsS. Also some of the open boss fights may put the enemy in unfair positions during attack animations, and make something potentially undodgeable (mainly the dragon so far, though sometimes the knight bosses)

Anyway, my feelings are complicated. I'd almost say it is a misguided effort, some of the new features aren't very useful or fleshed/thought out, however the gameplay works much better than it has any right to, certainly better than what happened with BOTW.

I'm giving it a 10 because the user reviews here are insane.",6,10

Los gráficos no son lo más avanzado que hay hoy en día, pero es FromSoftware y su estilo. Es Dark Souls; ningún Dark Souls se caracteriza por tener gráficos punteros para su época. Lo mismo con los controles; son controles de Dark Souls.
Este juego enamorará a todo fan de FromSoftware, pero puede que deje indiferente a los que vienen de nuevas. De ahí tanta reseña chunga.

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Excellent game. I have had performance issues on a fairly high end rig, but they are nowhere near as bad as reviewers and fans have been claiming (for me, anyway). The idea that the performance issues should drop the score I think is pretty absurd as I am pretty confident it will be patched and they have had no impact on gameplay for me.

In terms of the game itself, I give it a 10 out of 10 because none of the flaws are objective in nature. There are subjective flaws based on one's tastes but that's not the point of a review. I get bored of most games very quickly but have struggled to pull myself out of Elden Ring. It has the smoothest gameplay of anything in the genre due to the colossal world. If you are challenged by a difficult foe, you simply travel somewhere else and find something new to do.

The art direction and world design, the latter of which has plainly benefited from George R. R. Martin's contributions, is spectacular. I find myself very curious about the characters, places, creatures, and environments and eager to learn more. For instance, a gruesome and vile enemy, the Godskin Noble/Apostle, has me fascinated about their origins (and whose skin they are wearing). They are perhaps the most unsettling bosses I've seen From design yet.

The gameplay is superficially a step back from Sekiro, but one must consider the constraints imposed by the gargantuan variety of character equipment, skills, magic and so on. From that vantage point, it is a clear and unambiguous step forward for other action RPG's From has created, and so far has the best fights I have seen in the series yet (aside from Sekiro, which is competitive or still somewhat superior, although I have not finished Elden Ring yet).

Now, if you're not a fan of From's work and related work in this sub genre, I think Elden Ring may sway you, but it still has incredible challenges and other issues that will turn players off if they bounced off before. I would still recommend it unless you are absolutely not a fan of this style of game.

In closing, I'm not sure what the point of having a 10 point scale is if this isn't a 10.",6,10
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"This game is a culmination of everything FromSoft has done until now. It is vast, ambitious, and beautiful to behold.

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,I see people complaining for it being “too hard” get a grip it’s a souls game. People came into this knowing who it was made by and what the type of game it stands for. Either get good or stop playing it is a niche game market for people who enjoy a challenge if you cannot step it up and make en effort to get good at it stop complaining and go play a game that rewards players for the bare minimum. 10/10 game From did it again with an amazing game!,6,10

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"An absolute masterpiece in my opinion, Game does have some heavy frame rate issues and a few crashes for me personally, The online has some disconnection issues as well but my overall experience with how good it is and how expansive and wonderful the world is to explore those issues that I know will be fixed don't bother me, I'm 50 hours into the game writing this and I have no doubt it will become game of the year and it's well deserved. It's sad to see the game being review bombed and given 0's over the issues it has or things like ""bad graphics"" the game is incredibly beautiful in my opinion. It's no horizon forbidden west which is fine, the environment and style do a lot for me fromsoft are in a master craft of world building and art style. I have a hard time due to disabilities staying with games I feel I'm not good at and I give up quite easily but for some reason I haven't even had to take a break from the game. I've gotten angry yes but something in me kept wanting to persevere and complete the task I was stuck on and doing so gave me a feeling I can't quite describe. It's honestly been great overall for my mental health which probably sounds crazy but finding out I can actually keep going and accomplish something that' seems incredibly difficult is amazing for me. The massive amount of hate I've seen recently for the smallest of reasons is saddening but it doesn't change how great the game is. The game is also incredibly accessible to newer players or people who had a hard time with previous games. Yes it's still very difficult at times but you have the opportunity to explore the entire world and gear yourself and power yourself up for encounters you feel you cant handle yet and it highly rewards you for exploring.

If you take it a bit slower, it will be similar in difficulty to the old games.
If you take it very slow and out-level content it also fits the bit more casual player, although don't think it will be easy.

The open world and ""questing system"" are the new benchmark for the entire genre. For me it's one of the best games I've ever played.",3,5
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Alright, first things first, the port is a bit janky at points, but here's the thing: Less than 25% of people have beat the first Major Boss, and by far the most stuttering I encountered was on day 1 against the first minor boss, Tree Sentinel. I've played ~60 hours and haven't had any noticeable stuttering after the first 2 or so hours. I use a 1060 and r5 3600, for reference.

Everything else is amazing. It's been years since I was so captivated by a game. But know that this isn't Uncharted or Skyrim. You're not going to have cutscenes where political intrigue is discussed openly. The lore is rich but scattered and it'll be up to you to piece things together. You'll have to be attentive to this game, both in combat and out, there's just so much you'll miss otherwise.

I can also admit this isn't the game for everyone. It's challenging. It's made me very frustrated at times. But if you're honest with yourself, your failures are your own and are fair. You're at a disadvantage often and will have to fight uphill often, but if you learn about From's mechanics (Spirit Summoning, Magic, Co-op Summons, and enemy affinities/weaknesses), you'll be able to steamroll encounters by being their exact counter. That feeling of overcoming what feels unfair is the drug that makes these games special. Enjoy at your discretion, not at others' prescription.

Oooooo, Elden Ring.",3,5

There are tons of mechanics that makes this game a true RPG, of that kind we are not used to see, nowadays. And the story, check the descriptions of the items and try not to skip all dialogues, trust me. Finally, do you really think that Forbidden West is innovative?

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Where to start.

Well let's begin with all the 10/10 reviews. I do believe it is a amazing game, and I really enjoy it, but it has its flaws.

Network code: not much improvement from dark souls 3 and in general, online is a bit hard to get into. Had one item activated that should summon me into other people their world when they got invaded but never happened.

PC build/stable FPS: It is From Software their first open world and mistakes will be made. Where I didn't have too bad of a FPS drop on pc, I know others did. And I sure had some awful frame drops myself during certain fights. In the end, it will be patched out rather sooner then later so I do not feel like it is too far of a point to judge on.

Open world: Their first open world and they nailed it. The moment you step out of the introduction area, you can go wherever you wish to go in a stunning looking world. Walk around and stumble upon a cave? Well it has some neat loot in it and worth a grab. By far the best open world game for me.

Difficulty: The game can be as difficult or easy as you make it. The first boss people seem to be having issues with is Margrit, who is indeed difficult. But it teaches you to do something else. Go out and explore, level up, get stronger weapons and then return to properly fight him.

Everything together, it is a solid 8 out of 10 for me. Not everything is perfect, but which game is? A true love letter to the fans of the dark souls series.",3,5
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,Having played some of the other souls games I had some pretty high expectations for elden ring. This game undoubtedly just reskinned several assets however the open world and improved combat/enemies just took an already outstanding formula and expended upon it. Now I understand many people had performance issues with the game and were disappointed that the game was not especially optimised for pc but with any fairly decent pc the game should run with only a few choppy moments,3,5
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,This is the best game I've ever played. Graphics have improved greatly since DS3 and there are countless improvements and additions to the old souls formula. The map is massive and there are countless locations to explore.,3,5
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Note: English isn't my first language and if you are going to criticize me for my grammar then maybe come up with a better argument.Gotta love how people review bombed this lol. The game itself is a marvel. Bad graphic? I don't think so. The texture and details of you and the enemies' armor are well made, the map design is also one best I have ever seen. Bad Control? These guys probably spam roll all the time and expect to have unlimited iframe (invincibility frame) and stamina. Or in another case find something in the settings that are called key bindings. Lazy game design? More than 70 Unique encounters and f load of dungeons and catacombs scattered around the map, I wouldn't call that a lazy game. No Quest Log? Having no Questog is what makes the game immersive. Plus, grace (Aka checkpoints in the game) show on the map the direction where you need to go. The game is too hard? In Elden Ring, you are free to farm to be over-leveled and fight the boss which makes it easier than the previous Soul titles, or maybe just quit crying and try to get good at the game. All these people who review bombed this can't come up with an original idea and I'm pretty sure they don't even own the game, all they saw was ""Elden Ring has bad graphics"" ""Elden Ring is too hard"" ""Elden ring doesn't have a quest log."" And that's literally like the only thing they review bombed this for. Anyway, the game itself is packed with a load of content and a lot of replay potential. It's definitely worth 60 bucks.",3,5
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"If you're reading this, and love dark souls. just buy it. ignore all reviews. judge for yourself. if you have never played a dark souls game. this will be your easiest entry. but if you get frustrated easily, break controllers on losses, or have very short attention span... this may not be the game for you.

my review will be mostly addressing the Review Bombers complaints.

MY PC SPECS
for disclosure I'm running this on PC with a Ryzen 9 3900x, Gtx 1660ti and 32gb of ram and have been running it on 1080p.  I personally have no issues with performance myself, though I acknowledge that other pc users have. I have 50 hrs into this game

STUTTERS:
The stutters that I have seen others experiencing however are not game breaking. they look slightly annoying but seem to happen only on the first load of something you haven't seen before and still only seldomly regardless. if you are enjoying the game you will barely notice them (according to a friend who is experiencing them) I removed 1 point for that on my score and no more due to the review bombers doing more then their fair share already with zero scores for little to no reasons.

JUST A SOULS GAME:
review bombers are complaining its just another souls game but in an open world. Yes that's exactly what it is. and its what we were always told we were getting. This was literally never a secret. From day one of its announcement we all knew that, and its exactly what the fans wanted. everyone saw the gameplay prior to purchase. don't act surprised.

COMBAT:
review bombers have made claims that the combat is clunky. i assure you It is not. as a matter of fact it is extremely precise. as are the hitboxes. what may make it feel clunky, is if you button mash. this game, as all prior souls games have, punishes button mashing rather then rewarding it.

ANIMATION:
Yes there is truth to animations being re-used or in the case of NPC's talking. downright lazy on the developers. it would be nice to see an effort made there. I don't mind re-using some old properties on some of the enemies attacks. as there is far more new enemies with all new abilities.

GRAPHICS:
outdated looking graphics? this is a lazy complaint.  the game is quite gorgeous. could it be better. yes. is it bad. no. and it certainly isn't so awful it deserves a zero score for the entire game.

OPEN WORLD:
the bombers are also complaining the open world isn't rewarding or is dead space? this couldn't be further from the truth. you can't go more then a few seconds in any direction without finding a dungeon, a mini boss, a secret cave, an item or an NPC.  Elden Ring is one of if not the most densly packed open worlds I've ever played.

STORY:
people complaining that there is no story? The merit to this is that no, once again the game doesn't hold your hand and jam the plot down your throat with cutscene after cutscene. as a matter of fact if you aren't closely listening or reading you will very likely get lost in the ""plot"" as they don't rehash whos related to who or what things are over and over again. but there is story. and you get more and more of it with every NPC interaction you have. and its actually relatively easy to follow if you pay attention.

QUEST LOG:
its true the game doesn't give you a quest log. And it can be kind of hard to know where to go at times. however the game tells you EXACTLY where to go right off the bat if you speak to the first NPC you meet once entering the open world. and once you follow that bit to conclusion an NPC at the main hub (round table) tells you exactly where and who you need to beat next with lore and story on each enemy. hell  your map even marks where you are supposed to go for these with bright golden waves regardless whether you spoke to this NPC or not.

DIFFICULTY:
last but not least. its difficult. and there are built in ways to make it easier but no there isn't an option on the main menu. while it seems like a troll move. Hardcore players only advice to give you is to ""Git Gud""

But that's because its literally the only advice they can give you. There is no secret weapon or armor to make it easy. those can help but what matters is your skill. timing, rolls, parries, strategy and patience. Don't button mash, pay attention to your opponents move sets. avoid getting greedy in dealing damage. yes its hard. but in order to push forward, you learn from your mistakes and don't be afraid to get some help from some co-op if you need it. Git Gud sound a bit trolly. but its also the best advice you can be given.

CONCLUSION:
If you Enjoy Dark Souls games you will love this game. it's open world is beautiful. the combat is clean and precise. There are tons of ways to customize your character to be unique to you and like never before. there are a ton of quality of life upgrades, ""praise the jump"" take the review bombers with a grain of salt. in my opinion most of their complaints are likely to justify quitting because it was difficult.",3,5
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,Despite the stuttering (which for me doesn't happen much) I absolutely love this game. I love the difficulty and the open world. I believe this game has TONS of replay value with all of the different builds possible. Would absolutely recommend this game to anyone.,3,5
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,One of the best games ever made. People who are giving bad reviews because they suck are hilarious. HATE THE PLAYER NOT THE GAME.,3,5
"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Before i start, i want to say that every experience is subjective. So for you to have a little bit of context about my experience of the game :- I've already played and finished dark souls (I,II,III) and sekiro and i really liked those games.- I play video games regulary but i'm not that good, i can struggle and i'm not a ""sweat"" type player- I did not experienced any performance issues while playing elden ring for some reason, even with my laptop (gtx1070, 16 gb of ram)- Even if give the game 10/10, i don't think EVERYONE, should play it, every games are differents and offers differents type of experience and therefore, every game is not meant for everybody.BUTElden ring is for me a : masterpiece. As an artist who works in the videogame industry, i find the art direction unmatched, the graphical quality of the game is not meant to reproduce the reality with gorgeous texture but i look FANTASTIC nevertheless. As you progress to the world you are in constant ah of what the game as to offer in his character design, places, music everything come together to immerse the player in the dangerous world of the land between.The game in itself is extremely dense there are cave, ruin, fort, castle in every corner, and it feels really rewarding to be curious, because of the variety of enemies and unique loot to find in those caves. Even with an open world dense like that, the main level that you have to go through for the story have the same quality of the game before them, but with a lot more verticality you Can go 3 time in the same castle and find 3 differents way to explore it.In term of gameplay, for a ""souls veterant"" like me, i feel like this game offers the most ways to build your character in any ways you want, you can customize weapons by swapping theyre special attacks, and use whatever tool you want to tackle the game difficulty : you want to be a tanky mage ? A fast bowman ? A heavy knight with dragons power ? You can do it and mix everything while still maintining it viable and enjoyable.Now let's talk about the elephant in the room : The difficulty. If you're new to the serie i think this is the best place to start, elden ring is still challenging in the classical souls way, but there is a loot of tools to give the player a little rest in combat (like summoning npc to fight with you on command) and a lot of ranged weapons and ways to fight.Additionaly, elden ring being an open world you can explore the world to seamlessly lvl up before trying to tackle a boss. This give the player room to breath in between bosses.I will add that from software games are suffering from their reputation of being difficult. It's not an easy game, and it requires a little bit of getting used to. But after some time if you're willing to learn how the games works, you can finish the game without that much of problems. And i really encourage people to do it because it's really rewarding.For me who was tired of most  recent video games, Elden ring give the fresh experiencz i needed to ""fall in love in a game"" once again. The last time i felt like this playing was in zelda breath of the wild, it feels like i'm entering a new world, with everything to learn and it's a lot lot lot of fun.And uf you're worry about the lenght of the game, be not. It's really really big and it has a lot of quests outside of the main one, it take probalbly 80 to 100 hours to finish the first playthrough, without taking all the npc quests.So yeah 10/10 because Elden ring is exactly what itns aspiring to be, it's different from everything i've played, it's beautyfull it sounds good, the voice acting is perfect, i'm never bored while exploring the open world, it's not frustrating to fight boss, and it has a lot of replayability with all the builds and differents branch of quests(And yes it's different from dark souls, it's not just BIG DARK SOULS 4) Don't hesitate give it a go.",3,5

Now, I understand people will not dig the ""git good"" part of the souls community, but in this part, after seeing how bad kids put a 1 or a 0 just cause they are new or dont understand the games mechanics, is just unfair. This game brings all the best from all fromsoftware games, even Sekiro, to build up the best game you can ask for.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Elden Ring is a culmination of the mechanics presented in the souls games, bloodborne, and sekiro, all wrapped up in a depressing high-fantasy open world.

The Good
-While some optional side-bosses can be pushovers, the main bosses are well designed, intense, and challenging. Finding brief moments to breathe or windows to punish within the bosses flurry of blows are all the more rewarding, and victory is as exhilarating as ever.

-The art design continuously inspires moments of awe, disgust, and morbid fascination. The player will witness abominations with grafted limbs and tree roots absorbing dozens of corpses as food, but in the same minute, will emerge to see a beautiful overview of vast, twisted landscapes of golden trees, spiraling castles, misted swamps, and beckoning ruins.

-Progression blocks are non-existent, as paths are innumerable. If a player cannot beat a boss, they can excuse themselves to explore dungeons and ruins scattered across the world, where they will discover upgrades, gain experience, and continuously grow stronger until they are up for the challenge. The entire map can be explored from the beginning.

-Magic is more beautiful and satisfying than ever. The variety of spells at a players disposal has grown greatly. Miracles and Sorcery have received the biggest visual buff in this iteration by far and hit as hard as they look.

-Swordplay has been made more diverse and interesting. Players can discover ashes of war, special weapon skills, throughout the world. These not only affect the weapon scaling, but allow the player to customize weapons to their playstyle. Hold your dagger to the sky and buff yourself and your friends. Quickdraw greatswords like katanas. Call down bolts of lightning with your warhammer. Experiment to your hearts content.

More Good: QOL Open World Features. This open world game respects your time.

-Points of Grace, the checkpoints of Elden Ring, offer a fast travel system immediately with no cost or consequence.

-Stakes of Marika exist right next to nearly all challenging areas and bosses. When the player dies, they may choose to teleport to these Stakes instead of Points of Grace, allowing them to avoid wasting time repetitively traversing the same long path and re-challenge the boss or encounter immediately.

-The player receives their horse in an hour or less. The horse can be summoned anywhere in the open world from an item on the players belt, can double jump, and can be ridden in combat.

-There is no stamina loss outside of combat. Infinite sprinting and jumping while traveling from point to point.

-Crafting can be done on the go, anywhere, anytime out of combat. This includes arrows, bombs, consumable buffs, and elemental weapon buffs. No special stations needed.

-Basic materials are abundant, plentiful, and respawn on rest.

-Tears, the health and mana potions of Elden Ring, refresh on enemy pack kills. Players can seek out enemies to replenish their health instead of resting.

Nitpicks
-Certain enemies were directly ported from Dark Souls 3. The infamously annoying Thralls from Dark souls 3 have been reskinned as stout imp gargoyles that populate various catacombs and caves throughout Limgrave with zero changes to their move-sets. The giant crabs also reappear from the previous title with zero changes to their move-set. It would have been cool to see the developers renovate these enemies a little to make them distinguishable from previous iterations.

-I would have liked if the horse controls were tighter. The horse cannot turn a sharp angle without first moving forward, meaning the player cannot turn the horse around on a narrow platform without walking off the edge. Certain jump puzzles are also an unnecessary headache for this reason.

-The developers laid it on a little thick with the difficult encounters right from the beginning. While I personally love throwing myself at a difficult boss until I can overcome it, players unfamiliar with the souls genre that encounter the Tree Sentinel or Dragon just a stones throw away from the tutorial are in for a jarring experience.

-While I find many performance issues to be overblown at the time of writing this, they aren't non-existent. While in confined areas, the frame rate is completely stable. While in the open world, however, the frames will often dip into the 40's or 30's. This will hopefully be improved with further patches, but it would have done the game justice if optimization was up to a better quality before release.

-Players cannot ride horses while in coop. They are also confined to whichever area they have been summoned to, and coop is dissolved once a boss has been beaten. While this is not new to the souls genre, it's a little strange when implemented in the open world, as field bosses are often not too far apart from one another.

All in all, I cannot stop playing this game.",10,17
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Now over 40 hours into the PC release and this game is a BANGER,
This is the perfect Skyrim meets Dark Souls. You get that open world and exploration of Skyrim but you get the methodical and meaty gameplay the souls series is known for.
In Elden Ring FromSoft definitely cranked the difficulty meter up to an 11, some bosses taking 20+ attempts but I always feel like each death is a learning experience, luckily FromSoft was nice enough to give us very close spawn points to many of the bosses. Some of the smaller optional dungeons are interesting, the early one not posing much of a challenge but the later ones have some very cool unique bosses. Speaking of bosses, I love the design for so many of the new bosses, the combination of delayed and quick attacks really keeps you on your toes.
Now, the game isn't perfect. The most notable issue if the frame drops reported by many on PC and I've had some connection issues when in other players worlds. But these are very MINOR problems that will probably be patched with the net week or two, so I wouldn't let it deter you from buying the game (or rate it a 0/10 like a lot of people).
Overall, Elden Ring is a great game. There is so much to explore and so many unique bosses you can encounter in the game that will provide you with plenty of challenge on your way to becoming the Elden Lord.

""But it's just Darks Souls with horse and  jump button!""
I fail to see the problem here.",10,17

This game requires imagination. The story is not just fed to you and requires piecing together. Again, this may not be for everyone, but if you are the kind of person that likes to actively think and let their imagination run, you will find lots to explore here.

It's just not reasonable, even more, if you played the games that came this month alone (Sifu, Horizon) u just can't nail a 10/10 on this game, is unfair for the rest of the developers that put a lot of effort into their products. Sifu had way smoother gameplay and animations and Horizon feels like it is 5 years in advance in terms of visuals, the difference is gigantic. So what I think the game did good and bad:

Good:
+ World design
+ Exploration
+ Art design
+ Variety of enemies in the world
+ And let's say the level design

Bad:
- Graphics (textures, lighting, shadows, etc, feels like a 2014 title, not 2022 one)
- Voice acting, mocap, lip-sync (insanely bad for a AAA developer)
- Story (super generic, vague, diluted, the dialogs and characters are super cringe)
- Clunky controls
- Animations
- Sound effects (again super generic)
- 60Hz cap?? in 2022?
- Optimization, stuttering (for pc at least and for now, maybe it will be fixed with a patch)",7,12

"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,4,"I do not think this game is a masterpiece and it is not running well on PC. The world art design, diversity in playstyles makes this a solid game and with the help of Wemod it can be enjoyed by those who play games to relax. I do not find the story telling technique appealing anymore and I think the RR Martin was used for publicity only.

The biggest disappointment for me is the outdated gameplay mechanics. Sekiro had much more interesting gameplay, but in this game From Software just reused DS3 mechanics and implemented very little from Sekiro innovations.
There is still no animation cancel and reactive parry mechanic, forcing you memorize the enemy attack timing, which is highly variable. Rolling also looks ridiculous and could have been replace with a cool dash.

It is very annoying to check the map all the time to know where you are, I do not think this is an innovative way to make an open world game, it is just another lazy way to do it.

I also think this game had an unfair marketing strategy, there should be a warning about the difficulty in the marketing materials (""DO NOT BUY if you are not a skilful gamer, you are not welcome in the Lands Between, and you are wasting your money""). I platinumed Bloodborne and DS3 on PS4 and I was left with a bad feeling of what these games forced me to do because they charmed me with the world design and gameplay (at that time it felt more interesting, but not after you played for 800+ hours).",11,19

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"As a multiplayer FPS guy, I was very skeptical about picking this game up. But I caved into the hype and eventually gave it a go and I can confidently say this is one of my favorite games to release this year.

The multiplayer bloodstains and messages give it that charm that is missing from other games, and the invader concept is also pretty interesting and definitely gives the cooperative play an interesting drawback so that you can't just get carried.

The difficulty also makes this game not feel too jarring. A lot of the boss fights are well designed (apart from one of the first main bosses that brings a huge difficulty spike) and are fun to fight against. A great thing about the open-world aspect of this game is that you can always go back to a boss you can't beat if you're not ready.

Speaking of the open world, this game's open-world feels like it belongs. Some games that boast an ""open-world"" usually don't do it well, with the world feeling empty and soulless. This game however breaks that streak. There is so much to do and explore in the open world. The Currency/XP that you use to both level up and buy different items is awesome, as it encourages you to try to take on a boss that you failed to beat, or explore different areas. A criticism I have of the open world is that it doesn't feature traditional towns/villages. The ambitious open world clashed with the traditional Npc town system and made a single big Npc gathering area with vendors across the map.

Unfortunately, I do have to knock a point off for the Framerate issues on PC. While turning off Certain settings like motion blur, global illumination, and depth of field largely eliminates them, they are still there and are enough to make me put the controller down for the day.

Overall, This game is really good. If you are on the fence about buying it because you don't like souls game, I would say try it out for a few hours and decide if you want to keep it or refund it through steam. If you don't like souls games, It's possible this title could be an exception.

While I have only had the game for a couple days I've already put roughly 40 hours into the game and there still feels like there is a ton left to complete.

There has been a ton of QOL changes and new additions which makes the game better and arguably easier than previous titles. HOWEVER, there is still plenty of amazing, challenging, and fun bosses all over. I don't know the exact number but I'm already about 60 bosses in and while some are basic bosses a lot are really cool.

I've been playing on a midtier PC that I bought last Black Friday and I haven't had any real issues with the game frame rate or lag. I am only playing on medium settings though because I don't want to nuke my pc since it's really nothing special lol

While the majority of the game isn't really too difficult there are some bosses that may take a while to beat.

Each enemy feels unique, characters can be built exactly how you want and fight very differently, a true RPG.  There's also an actual sense of accomplishment for getting past bosses unlike most games today, skills matter here, no button mashing allowed.
Graphics are solid, not amazing but FS games definitely have a distinctive look and feel, almost like a painting, fits the fantasy genre very well.  The gameplay is fun as hell and the story isn't completely hitting you over the head every second, you actually have to pay attention and piece things together.
The only thing that keeps it from getting a 9 or even a 10 possibly are the micro stutters that still happen, they can be frustrating especially when in the middle of a fight.",4,7

- Too difficult for you, go play Hello Kitty Online in that case.
- Technical issues.

Sure the game could use some tweakings but for the love of god, what's not to like in this game. Amazing world, lore, progression, characters, battle system, crafting... it has absolutely everything. Even stealth and assassination.

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Just like Breath of the wild did a while ago Elden ring shows how a open world game should work.
There is no quest log, there is no mini map, there are no directions just your intuition and information you will only get by jumping into the world and start exploring.

Elden ring map is as beautiful as it is in size, there are many regions each of them with its own aesthetic and each of them more epic then the last, it is just so vast and rich in content that there will be times where you question how the hell was this game produced.
There are an insane amount of different enemies each of them with their own powers and fighting patterns and the boss fights are glorious.

The only thing that makes this game a 9 instead of a 10 is the performance in PC which to be honest is in an unacceptable state but the game is so good you will try to forget about this. I give it a 10 to compensate the 0, isn't it how Metacritic works?",4,7
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,2,"I might change this later if things improve. Anyway, here's my review for the PC version.

To start, performance is fine. I run it on a 1050 Ti with a newer CPU and runs fine other than stuttering. Then again, it just runs FINE, not well.

Game play is standard Souls. If you've played Dark Souls you have played this game as well.

The open world is boring. It's beautiful but serves no purpose other than a way to waste time between minor or major dungeons. Most, or all, progression will take place in those dungeons.

The major reason I give this a lower score is just bad game design. Every enemy and boss is disgustingly overtuned to a point where you have to wonder if the people planning these attacks thought they were for a DMC game. Now I have no issues with getting punished for bad play, but when every boss and enemy is whipping out 8-12 homing projectiles while swinging an instakill sword around, it gets to be a bit much. There is a boss who literally just fills the field with homing projectiles, half of which will kill you extremely fast, the other half will kill you instantly. She also summons minibosses while shooting these projectiles.

Don't get me wrong, I love a challenge. But this is not a challenge of your skill, it is a test of patience, as you oh so carefully traverse the area, memorizing enemy spawns and behavior, only to be hit by an enemy who just decided that animation frames weren't cool anymore.

If by the time I finish this game, the gameplay improves, I will remove and update this score. Otherwise, it's very mediocre with questionable game design choices I would expect from a first time indie dev.",4,7

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"The game is great if you're not severely effected by a variety of problems. Nobody is affected by all of the problems, but everyone typically has at least something that affects them.

Most common is that the game dumps and loads areas as fast as possible which tanks performance briefly. You can probably find the invisible triggers for the loading of areas with trial and error.

Another common one is that the game might run fine on high-end hardware for some people, but then run terribly for others because of something going on with the computer's priority settings.

Though I suppose it goes without saying that ""Vocal Minority"" of course exists with common complaints about Ultrawide support... when Ultrawide is a minority within a minority.

"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,7,"This game could have been perfect.

Before I start I want to say that I have thousands of hours on Fromsoft games and that they are my favorite games, and also that the 7/10 is score is not influenced by the bad PC  performance, not in the slightest. All of my problems with this game arise from the place that matters.. Design.

I could write a 5000 word essay about the flaws of this game and everything that brings it down, but that's too much commitment for a single game especially after an 82 hour playthrough.

I'm splitting this review into two parts, questing and bosses.

In short; the quests are random and there is no way for the player to tell what an NPC wants them to do or where they might have headed to without looking online or asking around. I spend 3 hours looking for Millencent's new location after I gave up and asked on r/EldenRing. Turns out she's supposed to be in the Alteus Plateau in Erdtree Gazing hill. How in the seven am I supposed to know that? Same thing with Ranni, I visited Ranni's Rise before killing Radhan and she wasn't there so I assumed that's all what the area had to offer, which obviously, is not the case. It feels like a King's Quest game more than a Souls game.

For the bosses, there isn't much to say. I can name 5 bosses that are probably the best boss fights of any game, Period. HOWEVER, it seems like Fromsoft got lazy after making the first quarter of the game and started copy pasting bosses all around the world. Often even repeating the DS2 sin where they end up putting two entirely different, independent and pretty tough previous bosses in the same non-optional boss fight because?

Frankly this game has frustrated me to the point of which I can't even write a proper review/rant it. I'm done with it and I don't think i'll ever be playing it again.

tl;dr : Sould you play it? YES. Is it the most flawed Fromsoft game? Yes, unfortunately",4,7
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Elden ring is in short, a nearly beautiful masterpiece.
It perfectly shows what From Software aims to achieve with each and every iteration of the games they develop and growing with each new one.
While the PC launch port of the game is suffering from some technical issues like frame drops, they are fully aware and are addressing these issues.
Its amazing how the game has launched in almost every platform in a near complete state which sets the bar higher for games that release at launch to be broken only to be fixed later (*cough*cyberpunk 2077)
This is truly worth the $60 dollars in my opinion.",4,7

That being said, the open-ended nature of the game can get disorienting at times, and make it hard to know what to do next. I do have a few other minor gripes, but just like its predecessors (except DS2) it feels like the game is fair and always balanced and just requires you to make the correct decisions in the heat of the moment.... UNTIL.... the frame rate stutters like crazy for no reason and then you die... Maybe when they fix the PC performance issues, I would bump this up to a 9... but I'm taking off -1 due to these issues as, even though they aren't game-breaking, they sure are dissappointing.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"The game itself is fantastic. It’s truly open world. The decision to alleviate all map markers and quest markers was at first daunting, but, ended up being a fantastic choice. It truly gives you the freedom to not be too tied to any quest-line and instead incentivizes the player to freely roam the world. From entry, there’s no hold handing AT ALL in this game. It’s truly up to the player to piece everything together and get combat down-pat all by their lonesome. This leads to an incredibly rewarding feeling when you finally beat a boss or even simply defeat a group of goons for the first time. Speaking of enemy variety, Elden Ring exemplifies enemy design and some enemies truly are nightmare fuel. They’re so imaginative but also strangely believable in this weird world. This game is definitely not for everybody. It requires immense patience, persistence, and sometimes will downright frustrate the hell out of you especially if you’re new to from software titles as I was. But when it clicks, it is truly a one of a kind game. The variety of combat is excellent. You can play this game in pretty much every way imaginable and they’re all fun. Timing a perfect parry or dodging just at the right moment is so incredibly rewarding when done right. Learning how to not be pummeled by a group of enemies and single them out is also rewarding. The challenge in this game, though frustrating, really gives out those dopamine hits once you complete something correctly. It’s made so well to frustrate you just enough but always make you want to keep playing.Graphically the world is straight up gorgeous but also dark and harrowing. The aesthetic of the game matches the challenge of it.All of this said, there are elements to this game that feel dated or weirdly lacking in polish. For one, it’s clear the pc port is definitely an afterthought. The settings leave much to be desired with no option for higher refresh rates than 60hz or widescreen support. It’s so laughable how little care they gave to the pc port. They didn’t even have the time to switch the display for controller button inputs to mouse and keyboard button inputs when playing. This means when going through dialogue, it’ll still show as though you should press “x” button to continue or exit the interaction on a game pad. I mean come on, changing this is the LEAST you can do. On top of it, the button mapping on pc is just awful. Shift+left click for alternate attacks or using the arrow keys to toggle quick items feels unbelievably bad. If you’re playing on pc, do yourself a favor and buy an Xbox controller to play the game with. They clearly did not have pc players in mind when coming up with the control scheme.The interfaces and ui feel extremely dated, unintuitive and clunky. While I completely disagree with players saying they feel as though the graphics are from a ps3 game, the ui and interface definitely feels generations behind. I understand this game is going for being difficult, but I didn’t foresee that difficulty leaking into frustration with ui such as an unreadable mess when opening your character’s stats. It makes the game so unapproachable for new players which is really a shame. Leave us up to our own in combat, sure, but at least let me understand what the hell I’m looking at when I’m in my inventory or looking at my stats. I understand I can open a menu for explanations on stat breakdowns but the breakdowns are awful and explain nothing. On top of this, it’s just downright ugly. When opening any options menu it really took me out of the beautiful game and was just off putting. It’s drab, dark, grey and doesn’t have 1/10 of the charm or thought that was clearly put into the rest of the game. I know you have a small staff, but please for the next game hire somebody who’s forte is UI. It’d truly level up the game.All of these downsides don’t take away from the fun I have, though. I don’t usually love open world games as they typically are super broad but have no depth and this game has both. There is so much packed into this game that I’m sure there’s tons I’ve missed while playing and that definitely up’s it’s replayability. Which means you may be playing this game for a long, long, long time.Definitely just don’t feel tight giving this game any less than a 9/10. A few hiccups here and there but all around stellar and a step forward for open world games.",4,7

Can't keep a perfectly stable 60 fps even on low settings 800x600 (thats when you know its gone too far)
Graphics are the same as any other souls game (that just adds to the fact that this game should run on any potato with stable 60 fps and 100/200+ fps on modern machines)

i'm glad the community isn't letting pure lazyness on PC ports get through like Critics do, this is a fast reaction time based game, smoothness is fundamental for a nice experience, if console players can't see the frame drops because they already playing on 25 fps with insane amout of motion blur that's not my problem. Souls game are the type of games to have ""performance mode"" run at 120hz and on PC have settings like Nvidia Reflex (like GOW did).

Is it possible to play the game on PC and enjoy it? Yes, after 1.02.1 I'm playing the game normally but I can't make my mind around the fact that we could be getting a much more enjoyable experience, imagine paying 2K$ for a GPU just to get a game with mid-tier graphics lock you at 60 fps and still have drops lol",4,7

The story so far is compelling and interesting, it follows the same formula as its Dark Souls predecessors (Player character is tasked with restarting/extending age of some godlike figure/mythos) but the way that the open world has lent itself to exploration and discovery of this story is amazing. NPC interactions are better than ever and the world feels very lived in with details to discover on every end of the map. Like in other FromSoft games guidance is sometimes necessary to discover more minute details but I've come to expect that after playing the games for so long. Elden Ring is an evolution of the FromSoft formula, and I think the extreme hype given to the game has attracted a crowd the unfortunately has not experienced a FromSoft game before and was put off by either its difficulty or inaccessability.

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,5,"Its alright I guess but definently not a 10/10, The main problem with this game is not dificulty (for me) but the absolute garbage game level design you have multiple areas where you are just underleveld and have to 'grind' souls in the open world to advance.

Im not even sure what the main intended path is for the game it just seems all over the place. Also be prepared to use the wiki/youtube guides a LOT Forgot a name the npc told you bring an item to? search the wiki. Want to find upgrade material? search the wiki. Want to fight 'hidden bosses'? search the wiki. For almost everything you do in this game you need a wiki or guide, A lot of places are not clear where to go and you get lost often (even with a map)

The way to upgrade your weapons is complete garbage, You can only really lvl up 1 weapon to max or be prepared to find all the upgrade materials all over again.

Open world? Yes I guess its nice but most of the games bests moments are not in the open world but rather in the closed dungeon/area sections.

Boss design is alright in this game a lot of realy unfair fights and you also dont know if you just have to git gud or if you are underleveled.

Story is just a **** show, you never know what the f is going on and the ending was just confusing not really satisfying for playing a game like 60+ hours

Pc port is a f*cking joke and performance sucks on pc also the game looks nice I guess but not cyberpunk level of grahpics and yet it needs a beter specs.

All in all I liked elden but to give this a 10/10 just goes to show how paid off these 'reviewers' are/ I dont really feel like a second playthrought because the game level design is so garbage I dont want to have to use the wiki for everything again.

5/10",4,7
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,7,"I really wanted to enjoy this more, but it plays and feels exactly like Dark Souls, and the same positives and negatives I have from those games carry over into this one.

As for the features unique to this game, the open world is incredible and so much fun to explore, however it makes it difficult to want to go back through it all again for a second play-through. There is an immense amount of bosses which makes exploration feel rewarding as it'll always lead to new equipment/spells/items, but some of the dungeons get repetitive and some bosses just feel like slightly more difficult enemies.

However, my biggest issue with the game is the awkward balancing. Some bosses and areas in the game felt to me personally, substantially too easy, maybe because I accidentally overleveled myself by exploring more difficult areas first. It felt weird to one-shot many bosses, something I don't think I've done in any other FromSoft game.

Don't get me wrong this game is good, but it's still just Dark Souls at it's core. I wish it had more of its own identity like Bloodborne or Sekiro. It will always be a refreshing experience to play a game by FromSoft, their tailor-made difficulty and priority on combat above all else is lacking from a lot of new releases. But I can't help but feel this is a step in the wrong direction. I'm still eager to see what they can come out with, but please no more Dark Souls, I expected something more unique.",4,7

"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,4,"If a Fromsoft game ever needed 'Patches' (sorry) it's this one!  I Would be rated higher but due to the serious technical issues on all systems it has to be a red score...for now.  Let me explain.Im a huge fromsoft fan and trust only them for day 1 preorders. I've platinumed all their games.  Buy It really worries me that blupoint demon souls remaster can launch at 4k 60fps or near to it but elden ring can barely hit 30fps and often dips as low as 15 in sadly the areas where you need consistent performance.  On pc it runs better with improved graphics but all I get is decade old graphical and gameplay issues on pc even with a 3080.There is a whiff of cyberpunk about the game where fans are blindly supporting and conveniently ignoring the serious technical issues which also include a few progression stopping glitches / bugs and the occasional game breaking issue.And post launch the patches are not addressing these issues. It still looks and runs like a...decade old and at times elden ring just looks ugly.  Great art design but everything else is far from the beauty of sekiro or the grandeur of bloodborne.The open world simply fails in 2022. If it was 2010 then I'm sure it be far more impressive as it has 2010 graphics. It's not remotely as good as botw or rdr2 which are games that existed before ER development even started. The latter alone is worrying  but the large empty space which witcher 3 dlc would laugh at...isnt much fun to play. Yes You can explore but you'll only find Skyrim like identical copy and paste areas. Forget the wildlife of most open world games or npcs with compelling stories.The George Martin element is inexplicably non existent making the game effectively a dark souls 4. The latter isn't a bad thing but it's not as good as ds3 in visuals / performance or gameplay so where does this leave us?Without widescreen or controller support at times that's where !   The game isn't suitable for noobs or non fromsoft fans. It's a game seemingly more for fan boys, prepaid journalists and shills to scream ""goty!"" while they wait for gameplay saving 'Patches' (sorry ;). It's not a bad game by any means but it has bad aspects to it or lazy maybe.  Bloodborne launched in a rough state so this is nothing new but it's still not acceptable.Wait for a sale a year from now when it's been fully patched.  Eventually maybe 7-8 /10 but a 4/10 !t launch due to poor technical state :(",5,9
"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,5,"Cons: Boring. parry doesn't work. You need to do a lot of work to make you own fun and read into no story at all. The hate keyboard+mouse users. Runs awful on PC.
Pros: Beautiful game and great enemy design.",5,9
"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,4,"The game is pretty good, i enjoyed it, but the recent patches make the whole thing an even bigger technical mess then it was.
I get crashes and stutters more often after 1.02.3 to the point of literally breaking my saves, good that i make a backup after every session, now i do it more often.
But the whole port is just the epitome of bad, no ultrawide, 60fps cap, they didn't even include a button prompts for PS controllers that are already in the game, where STEAM fully detect it.

They try to fix it, but game quality slowly deteriorates with each patch, i just can't give this game a good note, the PC port is broken for me.",5,9
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,7,"Lots of performance issues, it makes the game feel off compared to the console versions.",5,9
"Mar 20, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,5,"It's a solid game but it has a few serious flaws that stop me from enjoying the game.

First of all, I don't think the framerate drop is as bad as others say. My specs are RTX 2070 &amp; i7-9700k, playing at 1440p max everything, and though out my first few hours, my average FPS is 50-60 FPS, sometimes dropping to 30-40 FPS. Anyway, the FPS hiccup during the boss fight is seriously annoying

However, Elden ring's PC port is honestly terrible, what I can't stand is the user interface, especially as a mouse and keyboard player.
For example:
1. Some functions can't rebind, ex: map can only be open by pressing G.
2. You can't use the mouse on the map, the mouse is useless (WHY?).
3. Can't change the camera with a mouse when talking, can only use a keyboard. (Werid)

What frustrated me the most is that they improve the user interface on the Dark Souls III and Sekiro PC port, but then go backward to the Dark Souls II. Sadly, just like Dark souls II PC port and its many issues, it will most likely never get fixed. Sadly, you just need to get used to it.

Update: One major issue, please bring back the old Dark Souls covenant system, the world is empty and lifeless without invasion. You can't really be a good guy if there is no bad guy, the Blue Cipher Ring (the new Darkmoon) is broken because no one really bothers to invade anymore.

Update 2:
+ The developer fixes some serious PvP glitches and skip-dialogue glitches in the new patch. Good.
+ Now we have NPC marker, still not perfect like a quest log, but definitely an improvement nevertheless. Still, this game is impossible to 100% complete without wiki because sometimes NPC would randomly and permanently die for no reason just because you explore other places.
- I realize a lot of the content is just copied and pasted, sometimes even thoughtlessly put two random bosses together, resulting in crappy gameplay.
-Also, the game is very unbalanced, some gimmick bosses have an unreasonably big hitbox, extremely fast moves, very long combo (literally keep I-frame rolling until run out of stamina), 360 degrees 100% auto-aim. I wonder if the designer really tests plays this game themselve.",5,9
"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"A must play. Do yourself a favor and don’t listen to the negative reviews from maidenless gamers who have been conditioned to need easy games, hand holding, and no thought. This game is not that. Most the the negative comments are explained by lack of attention to detail. There is literally a tutorial 10 minutes into the game. There is a rich story. There is a rich and beautiful environment full of life. The game has built on the successful gameplay and atmosphere from previous titles. Get the game, take it slow, learn, pay attention and thank me later.",5,9
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Elden Ring is another addition to From Software's repertoire, breaking from the normal souls-like formula with a new and incredibly well crafted open world. The Lands Between beckons the player to explore, discover, and conquer an intricately crafted world filled to the brim with content.

Elden Ring demands the player to find their own purpose, there is no quest log or markers, no arrow pointing you forward, just a simple guidance, a nudge, pointing you in the path one might take. This is Elden Ring's greatest strength, as a player just starting the game one can easily choose to go anywhere, and explore one of the most fantastical worlds yet seen. From the very start of the game, past the short tutorial section, the player has access to around 40% of the entire map, all without needing to fight a single enemy. And when I say 40% of the game, I do mean 40% of what took me, a souls-like veteran with years of experience, 80 hours of playtime; and even then I was still unable to complete everything, missing a huge section of the map hidden right under my nose!

However, it must be stated that, like how I introduced the game, Elden Ring is a soulslike first and foremost, this means crushing, if not brutal, difficulty. Elden Ring has no difficulty slider, instead there are many other options by which a player can make the game significantly easier. Build variety and the usage of online play can make the difficulty spikes in the game simply melt before you, and with the new system of spirit summons even singleplayer, never seeing a second of online play, leaves you open to an effective (and at times even stronger) version of online summoning. Elden Ring is also open world, allowing the player to simply go a different path whenever they encounter a roadblock, leaving them time to get stronger and better prepared. There is never a time limit to these games, and with fast-travel readily available from the moment you step into Limgrave you'll have plenty of opportunity to zip to and from places of interest.

Elden Ring separates itself from most open world games with its dungeons, various dungeons litter the Lands Between, each being unique and difficult in their own right. Of course, these are all preludes to the real meat and butter of From Software's designs, the new Legacy Dungeons are back to form, with sprawling and maze-like complexity of the previous iterations of the souls series coming back in force, I spent around 7 hours in the first Legacy Dungeon, Stormveil castle, and I later came to realize that it was possible to reach the final boss of the area in under 10 minutes of having entered! These huge sections of the map will challenge you just as much, if not even more, than the bosses themselves.

Online play has received a rather large rework, with the new incorporation of the furled finger allowing solo players to play online without any fears of getting invaded (by players at least). The new co-op rework allows for up to 2 other players to join you in jolly cooperation, however be warned, in summoning another player you are now susceptible to being invaded. And that brings us to the PvP scene, which is just Dark Souls 3 but without the two-hit stun that were so common, and backstabs are all but gone as well. Be warned however, no matter how strong you think you are, there is some invader out there who can and will trounce you.

I unfortunately cannot discuss the performance issues this game suffers, as I experiences very few during my playtime myself. Meeting all the recommended system requirements I only suffered frame rate loss between load zones or under some rare circumstances. So read up on some other reviews!

It should also be noted that this game has received a large amount of review bombing, so shave off about 300-400 of the negative reviews and you might get a more accurate descriptor of the user ratings. This is because of controversy over the incredibly success in sales Elden Ring has had compared to their rival Horizon Forbidden West releasing just a week before Elden Ring. To anyone reading this, please do not spread negative reviews without justification for either of these games.

Elden Ring is open world dark souls, with an amazingly crafted open world design that is filled with over 80 hours of content; and not some flimsy ""content"" fetch quests made to waste your time, but real engaging and unique content throughout the game. The game is difficult, and will challenge you, but with an open world design it is possible to simply travel elsewhere and better prepare oneself. Accessibility has never been better for these games, with the new spirit summons Being an incredibly powerful tool added to your arsenal. Invasions and coop are now required to be activated by the player, so no need to stay offline to avoid those pesky invaders.

I hope everyone reading has a good idea of Elden Ring, and why it's so highly rated. be seeing you in the Lands Between, fellow Tarnished",5,9

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,6,"The design of the game is impeccable. However, the release is pretty shoddy. The game is nowhere near graphically intensive enough to run this poorly on high end hardware, and the stuttering is insufferable. I have a 3080, 58800x, and 32gb RAM, yet this clunker often struggles to hit 60 fps. Cyberpunk 2077 ran smoother, had much higher end graphics, and also had an open world. That, paired with the 60fps cap and the ham fisted lack of Ultrawide support kind of ruins this. It's even more annoying because the game is rendering everything behind the black bars on Ultrawide as has been illustrated by many people, yet you have no option to remove them and they're entirely cosmetic.

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Thanks Metacritic! Today you just taught me to not trust users review! I will tell my honest opinion about the game:

this game could be easly a 10 game but is a 9/10, because is true, it has some little thechnical problems and very minor defects (BTW without compromise the playability of the game), and JUST because that. In fact, this game is still SO FREAKING AWESOME!!!! I give 10 in order to compense the other sensless users bombing reviews, and it's really sad because look more like an outburst of frustration than an honest review and these are the same people who tells that this game lacks of content!!! Are you kidding me?? Guys trust me, i played all FromSoftware games. I missing only bloodborne cause i am a PC gamer and if you like the Dark Souls Saga and also to be more generic if you like Fantasy/Dark Fantasy, you need this game!! You cannot image the quantities of stuff to do in this game and how huge it is!! The open world its at least more than double of how much i expected to be. Can be compared to Zelda BOTW or to The Witcher 3(plus with an huge vertical extension). The start could seems a little bit quite, but after few hours of gaming Elden Ring start to have great Rhythm. There are so many different paths to take and things to do. You never get bored and some of the places are really astonishing and everything with the dark souls style(i see also a lot of LOTR, Berserk and  of course GOT vibes in the game but not just a copy rather a new marvelous masterpiece)! This game is Epic in every single aspect: gameplay, art style, level design, lore and in my opinion the author has just outdone himself with this fantasy MASTERPIECE!  Its true has some little defect but i think they will solve it soon so just give it a change! This is the game we was waiting. Thanks again Miyazaki. i love you and i hate you, just as always!",14,26
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,7,"I have the feeling that the target audience for this title will dislike my take on it a lot. Please keep in mind that I'm only reviewing this game from my personal taste and as someone who has never touched a Souls game. So, let's start with what is actually mindblowingly awesome about this game: The freedom, the world, the creature designs, the epic narrative. I will absolutely admit that those are all superb and the game is better for having those qualities. But they are not what makes a game fun for me. A fun game has, above all else, fun gameplay. And even in that aspect it appears to strike absolute gold for most people - But I'm unfortunately not one of them. Here are my issues: The rune system - In some aspects, it's really well done and it's much more believable as an in universe way to become stronger, unlike classic Exp. But for my taste the game is way to unforgiving and should provide multiple difficulty options, with easy mode being a way to not having such a high risk of losing your collected runes. Yes, the gameplay loop is designed with the player not keeping all of their runes in mind, but that doesn't make it less frustrating and time wasting. People will tell me to simply ""gid gud"", and I'd probably have a much greater time if I did, but that's not the point. People are begging Game Freak since 2017's Let's Go to be able to turn shared Exp. off in Pokemon games so they become a bit more challenging, and rightfully so! But in the same way, there is also nothing wrong with wishing that developers made their games more accessible. Just as the option to turn shared Exp. off in Pokemon games wouldn't ruin the fun for people who actually like the ""lesser grind"" in those games, having an accessible easy option in this game wouldn't ruin the game in any way for Souls veterans! Next, the combat - I can absolutely see what they are going for and why the combat in these games is so beloved. They took action based combat and gave it more of a turn based feel. Unfortunately, it is not for me. To me, it is the worst of both worlds - It's not as quick and intuitive as combat in other action games, nor does it provide the freedom of having a huge amount of moves that turn based games offer. Finally, staples from other open world RPGs that I'm missing from this - A quest catalogue and markers, or the simple function to pause the game while playing it - I see why they designed it that way, I know it has benefits, but again, why isn't there at least an easy option so people like me can have the same amount of fun as more skilled players? So: Is this one of the most impressive games I've ever played? Absolutely! Is it one of the most fun games I've ever played? In my opinion, no. Do I regret buying it? A little, at least for full price. But it's fine, it's still a really good game. Even with how frustrated I am with it, I still have the urge to keep playing, wich just shows how incredible the parts of the game are that I do like. I just don't know how long it will keep me entertained until I go back to something that I fully enjoy.",7,13

Good things
The open world is incredibly vast. It has many secrets, dungeons, and other things all around the world. The terrain feels realistic and it always seems like there is something next to you.
The hitboxes are very good. There have been times when a sword has just barely missed me when I was attacking. I have not died once to bad hitboxes.
Enemies are varied, have many attacks, and have good ai. Some of the bosses will hunt you before attacking.
The bosses are phenomenal. They feel as though you are versing someone who is stronger than you.
The horse, jump, and crouch feel very good.
Stealth feels like it works this time.
Great story as always
I am always trying out something new, which is very good
The rewards you get at the end of side content are meaningful

Mixed things
The graphics could use some updating. While they are not bad graphics, they are not as good as they could be
Pop-in can be very annoying but is not super noticeable when you aren't paying attention.
Some dungeons and mini-bosses can feel copy-pasty.

Bad things
There is constant stuttering and low frames. People with the best pcs are still having this problems.
I've heard people are unable to launch the game
There is no ultrawide support*
The fps is capped a 60*

All in all, this game could have easily been one of the best if From Software had they put effort into the visuals and playability of the game. I have a feeling that this may be their final time doing this before change happens. Elden Ring is easily one of the worst games that they put out in terms of optimization. With a large influx of players coming in, people are talking about these problems more than ever. I believe that From may see these problems and finally fix them for the better.

*I've heard that these things are already fixed by mods",11,22
"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"I have no idea what the other people reviewing this game are talking about.  I’ve been extremely disappointed in the video game industry in general in the past few years.  Nowadays, games are made to please investors and make the most money with the smallest amount of time and/or money possible (i.e. cyberjunk 77, battlefield 2042, recent call of duty games).  This game (Elden Ring) actually feels like the creators cared when they made it.  It feels like a work of art with years of effort put into it.  Its engaging, challenging, beautiful, rewarding, and surprising.  The only complaint I have is that combat is the main focus of the game and there is little content that doesn’t force you into combat.  This isn’t a huge issue, however, because the combat is technical and interesting and the AI is extremely well-tuned.  There’s no (or very very little) rest from combat in the form of minigames or side-activities.  This can become exhausting after a while.  However, this game feels like games used to feel - it surprises frequently with hidden quests, bosses, items, and lore.  The FPS drops have only noticeably occurred during the first mini-boss (tree sentinel), but other than that I haven’t had any other noticeable FPS drops, and my computer setup is mediocre, at best.  Do not listen to all the people complaining.  The FPS drops can be frustrating, but the game is highly entertaining and, to me, is worth playing regardless of the infrequent frame rate issues.",11,22
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,5,From Software with yet another solid entry. Many will say their best piece of work yet.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"This game is a masterpiece and is exactly what I would want in terms of an open world dark souls game.

No quest markers, no hand holding, and amazing exploration. I'm constantly finding new side bosses, areas, NPCS, and other mysteries. Nothing is straight forward and the game rewards players for being inquisitive and taking their time.

I get chills jousting insane bosses on my horse with an enchanted two handed sword. This is the type of gameplay I dreamed about when I was a young boy, and to see it finally come to a reality is an amazing experience.

I have a very high end rig, and I will admit that I have ran into a couple of stutters. Dark Souls PC ports have always been rough around the edges when they first release, and this one is no different. The lack of widescreen support was also a disappointment. I know both of these things will be fixed through the modding community or by the devs themselves.

However the game is just so amazing in every other way that these minor issues are very easy for me to look past.

This game is easily in my top 5 games of all times, and may end up being my favorite RPG of all time by the time I finish.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"As a Soulsborne fan that started the series back in Demon's Souls era, i can feel the love and passion put in this game. I played for 10 hours so far, i am absolutely hooked. This is truly the combination of every Soulsborne (+Sekiro) game and it just works.

Pros:
+The world is beautiful and intricate, from its inhabitants to its castles and forts. I couldn't help myself and wander around randomly only to find out ruins, caves, minibosses, mysteries to solve, and quests. FromSoftware, again outdid themselves with the art design.

+The combat is brilliant, fun and fast-paced combat from BB and DS3 is back and improved further. From the jump attack mechanic to block-counter combined with many Arts of War (weapon skiils) you can find to customize your weapons, While some animations from former titles comeback with improvements, there are also lots of new animations. My biggest concern is Scythe's backstab animations, as i've only played for 9 hours, i haven't tried them yet. I do hope they have an unique animation.

+The Music is amazing as always, composed by talented Yuka Kitamura.

+The Graphics are also very beautiful, from light poking through leaves in a dense forest to the early morning fog after rain. The NPCs, faces, armor textures, details on weapons. The game looks fine even on low graphics.

Neutral
+/- Performance-wise, i didn't really have much problems except some stutters here and there. I'm running the game on 1080p Medium settings with Textures on Ultra, i am receiving 57-60fps on caves, hub-area, ruins and the first legacy-dungeon while receiving 35-40 fps on overworld. I am happy with the result since i am under the minimum requirements.

+/- The game runs fine with 8GBs of RAM although i'd recommend 12 or 16GBs

Cons:
-Even though i haven't experienced many performance problems people have been reporting, this is currently a common problem even occuring for people with high-end systems.
-Controller issues
-EAC
-No FPS options, you can neither limit nor unlimit.
-Stonefang Miners from Demon's Souls are back

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,Frame drops now and then but its not unplayable either acceptable a game which costs 60 bucks must be polished no matter what it must be top quality and keep in mind that ELDEN RİNG İS NOT EVEN NEAR A BAD GAME the world is beatiful it really is but i saw some people complaining about it not being as good as demon souls i dont think its possible to do such a big game with that much care because demon souls is not a open world game there are some passages and ways they have to do so it is easier its like expecting Last of Us tier graphics in an open world game although we have red dead redemption 2 which is amazing graphics in a big map but it took them serious years and money so I admit elden ring is not the best looking and best textured game but it is neat  I HAVE NO COMPLAİNS ABOUT GRAPHİCS the gameplay is near the same as the dark souls game with some things added i guess no one has any complains about it now for the difficulty I would say its neither the easiest nor the hardest souls-borne game  I wont even bother to talk about the story but ı must say the atmosphere is really good those godly trees really look good so ıf we come to a conclusion Im playing on a pc so it really has some performance issues but most things beside that are generaly possitive for me also im sure from software will fix those issues in some time,8,16

Nombreuses critiques plébiscitent le jeu, mais aucune ne parle des soucis technique (ou alors minimisent ça dans la prise de note, du genre ""quelques défauts technique"").

Objectivement, Elden Ring est un jeu moyen des années 2010. La version PC est indigne de son public, comme les précédents jeux From Software. Franchement, j'ai eu de la patience, j'ai voulu y croire, je me suis dit qu'au moins un maigre effort serait fait sur la version PC : et ben non.
Joueurs PC, je vous le dit, c'est (encore) un gros doigt d'honneur érigé à votre égard.
""nan mais vraiment t'abuses un peu le jeu est sorti sur PC et il est jouable"". Ok, tu veux jouer à ça ? Bien alors :

- Graphiquement, on est sur un jeu pas mal des années 2010 (pour mémoire Elden Ring est sorti en 2022 hein)
- Le portage PC est une fois de plus une insulte : Pas de localisation clavier/souris ""Appuyez sur LB pour faire ça"" . LB ? connais pas, je joue sur PC!. Alors oui les mauvaises langues me diront ""bah t'as qu'a jouer à la manette"" et a ces gens là je répond : ""ok, ton jeu sur XBOX ou PS n'aura droit qu'à des menus indiquants ""appuyez sur CTRL gauche pour continuer"". Quoi, t'es pas content ? bah t'as qu'a jouer au clavier et à la souris. Non mais clairement y'a des jeux qui détectent si tu joues au clavier/sours ou a la manette, et qui modifient leurs touches d'interactions en temps réel en fonction de ce que tu utilises. Et une grosse production comme Elden Ring ne sait pas le faire du tout ? C'est du foutage de gueule.
- pas/peu de réglages graphiques : Toi joueur PC avec un écran 144/165/240Hz, tu voudrais en profiter ? Alors fermes les yeux, écartes les fesses et laisses toi faire : pas de possibilité de supprimer la VSYNC, pas de réglage de framerate : le jeu sera cappé à 60hz point barre. ""Ouais mais c'est déjà bien"" me diront les joueurs consoles = nan mais mec, t'achètes une Ferrari qui ne dépasse pas le 130km/h, tu vas voir le vendeur et il te dit ""nan mais 130 c'est déjà bien, ça sert à rien d'aller au dessus ! Et tu acceptes ? Non merci !
- On peut régler l'ultrawide. Non je rigole, bien évidement vous pouvez oublier
- du clipping à outrance, un framerate beaucoup trop bas et beaucoup trop instable pour un jeu ""si moche"" = c'est totalement la honte en terme de perf sur PC. On est dans le bas du bas du panier des portages pc.

Ok alors, From Software, je m'adresse à vous là : visiblement, vous ne savez pas faire un portage pc. Alors pourquoi vous vous acharnez à livrer ça dans cet état ? Certains jeux à 20/30 balles font tout mieux que vous en terme de portage PC (framerate débloqué, localisation clavier/souris, performances correctes). Du coup, ce n'est pas une question de moyen puisque des studios y arrivent : c'est donc ce que vous vous foutez complètement des joueurs PC ?
Alors soit vous faites des portages honnêtes, soit vous arrêtez de vendre votre merde sur PC (mais comme les From Software se vendent très bien sur PC, j'imagine que c'est comme pisser dans un violon... Pour rappel, pour débloquer +60 fps sur Sekiro PC, il fallait soit un trainer soit un mod. Et c'est pareil pour ce Elden Ring) . Derrière y'a des clients qui achètent ça et qui sont déçus... Oui je sais, ça va se vendre, ce sera le GOTY etc etc... mais désolé, intrinsèquement ça reste une énorme merde sur PC, et y'a pas d'autres mots. C'est pas très beau, ça rame, c'est bloqué à 60FPS sans ultrawide, y'a du clipping, et tout ça ne sera jamais corrigé, c'est certain. Mis à part les chutes de FPS qui seront éventuellement patchées.

Du reste, le jeu est sûrement bien hein, mais si ça vous tente, achetez le sur n'importe quelle plateforme mais pas le PC.",7,14

I've been playing for 110 hours and explored almost each and every secret. The experience is huge and epic. I am a bit disappointed by the final bosses and the endings: they are poorly written, there is also some boring repetition of the content. It's an 8.5. The Witcher and Skyrim remain unmatched.",5,10
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"that hype train for 0 rating is annoying, this game don't deserve it. elden ring gave me feeling of old true adventure, which was unobtainable for a long time, and now i finally get it. it returns me to my school days, where world was much more colorful. we played games and shared our achievements on them to each other. spoked about interesting secrets and emotions we found. and we didn't complain about fps and graphics, because game must be game to play, not the beautiful movie to watch, that vast majority here wants to see.
but this game is not ideal.
here we have not the the best controls on PC. for example, i must un-press dodge key to start dodging, it;s annoying sometimes.
we have 60 fps lock, so I just use mod to control it by myself (it's not critical for me).
sometimes game have stutters, while loading grass or something, but 99% of time i don't experience them.
and... seems like that's all the problems for me?
i was surprised by narrative, i like how it goes. gameplay is challenging, and i like it too. i can't get bored while i playing it, cause this game can surprise you in sudden times.
we must confess about how the game feels in it's genre circles, not about how it don't serve you and your expectations (if you had them before play session).
So:
Narrative - 10/10 (was surprised not about the exact story, but about how it goes)
Art style - 10/10
Boss mechanics -  9/10
Adventure - 10/10 (true adventure is when you don't know what to expect next)
Open world - 9/10 (got botw and skyrim vibes while playing)
Combat - 6.5/10 (just because of not the best controls on PC, where i'm playing. need a lot of time to get used to it)
Soulslike - 8/10 (it's open world experiment, so i think it's pretty nice and almost friendly for newcomers)
I was thinking about RPG, so i guess free leveling it's just part to make game playable within souls genre for newcomers. 7/10
after all, 9/10 GOTY for me.

Story... to the people complaining that there is none; the story is always hard to understand but it is told through item descriptions and the environment. It is like a puzzle and it is my favorite part of these games. Kick rocks.

A lot of people are complaining about performance but I have been able to smooth my game out and get a consistent 60 fps with very minimal issues just from adjusting all my GPU settings and running in borderless windowed mode. Is it disappointing that From Software doesn't push the boundries with graphics or even attempt to optimize their games to run at 100+ fps? Yes, but do I care .... nope not when they keep putting out quality products.

Graphics - feels a little dated but overall still solid - 8/10
Controls - as a soulsbourne fan its got that old familiar feel, nothing wonky, works well - 9/10
Gameplay - its been very challenging and I like the additions of the mount and plenty of checkpoints so you can teleport around with ease. the game has been super enjoyable for me. having a full world to explore within a soulborne game is epic - 10/10
Story - thus far it holds similar to most other From Software games where you need to talk to a lot of npc's and read item descriptions and whatnot to get a good grasp on whats going on, but I find it very interesting so far - 10/10

The game is a lot more polished at release than most titles are these days, even with the few issues with performance here and there. They will patch the issues as we move forward and the game will only get better. A large chunk of the bad reviews are going to be people who experienced performance issues or people who didn't realize what they were getting into. I would NOT recommend this for anyone who couldn't hang in a previous soulsbourne game as its much of the same. For the rest of you, good luck Tarnished.",4,8

"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,"I actually own the game. I can't say this for people giving it a 0/10 because Ther's no possible way it deserves that. Must be people who rage quit and left a rager review because they decided having to actually play a game, is asking too much.
I put 90 hours in my first playthrough alone, on PC.
Which to me, is rare.
I did everything.
If you really like Souls games for their atmosphere, and their lack of hand holding, Elden Ring is a must play for you.

Story 7/10 - It's basically the same concept as the other souls games, but the formula obviously works in this type of game.
Gameplay 9/10 - The vast amount of enemies and weapons, spells, is just insane. There are hundreds, if not thousands of possible playstyles dependings on what you have equipped.

Graphics 8/10 - Not the best, but its still a gorgeous looking game with great design.

Evironment 10/10 - They really know how to build beautiful looking places, from snowy mountains, to rotting depths, to blood soaked ruins of a forgotten underground palace.
Dont even get me started on Norkon.

Optimization 8/10 - apparently people dont know that you can entirely fix the stuttering issues in the Nvidia control panel and one click in windows settings.
I guess it's easier to cry and moan about something than to actually find the fix for it and implement it yourself. I would like to see the 60 fps cap removed for people who want that option. I guess make it so you're offline without risking a ban? something official wouldbe nice.

Overall 8/10.

It's a very good game that definitely doesnt deserve the low scores it's getting from accounts, who somehow only have 2 reviews on their profile, this and forbidden west. fishy.
Most of them also left a 0 score on every platform Elden Ring is on. Definitely something weird going on there, as I doubt those people have played this game on 5 different platforms.

Great work from FromSoft. Keep doing what youre doing and dont ever change to appease the baby crowd.",4,8
"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"By far FromSoftwares best game yet, Elden Ring is a masterpiece on nearly all fronts, with only a few minor issues stopping it from getting a 10. If your a fan of these games, play Elden Ring now you will love it. It's the culmination of everything FromSoftware has done ever since 2009 with the release of Demons Souls.

The open-world is surprisingly good, I was worried we'd be getting a super dead world with just fields of grass, and while that does occasionally happen, its usually quickly broken up by something that'll catch your interest, whether that be a castle in the distance, or massive tree, or one of the many dungeons. The dungeon system is a great way to split up the world and give you stuff to do, it's a welcome addition that adds so much more content. While they can occasionally be a bit repetitive and some of them are way too short, their for the most part well done.

My only complaint would have to be the dungeon's reuse of bosses, once you've done a couple of these dungeons your likely to run into a boss that you've already fought once and likely more. This is likely my biggest issue with the game, bosses are reused so frequently that it becomes a joke after a while, even some bosses that are in the main story are reused as either another boss or a damn enemy type. it just comes off as really disappointing and lazy, especially when they can't even be bothered to change some of these reused bosses up in the slightest, one boss, in particular, is used over 10 times and is the exact same every single time. Some may not consider it that big of a problem, but to me, as someone who considers the bosses to be one of the most important aspects of a FromSoftware game, it was really disappointing to see. Thankfully the main story bosses make up for this issue and are all amazing, there wasn't a single one that I didn't like, and Elden RIng has by far the best bosses in the franchise when it comes to the main story alone.

Even fighting these guys in Co-Op is lots of fun, their extremely well balanced and can actually be very challenging even with 3 other players. With the bosses being given a bunch more health, and actually switching targets from player to player, and using wide sweeping attacks to hit everyone on the field. And thankfully it's easier than ever to get into a world with 2 of your friends, as the item used for summoning is extremely easy to get using the new crafting system. The flowers used to craft it are everywhere and respawn, so if you ever run out, all you have to do is farm some flowers for about 5 minutes and your set. Unfortunately, PVP is nowhere near as good or well thought out as Co-Op was. When you're dueling a player whos using a fair build, then the 1v1's are extremely fun and intense but occasionally you'll run into someone using an extremely broken build that you can't do anything against. This is a problem I've only recently run into, so it could be patched soon, but this game's balance is currently a nightmare, there are insane one-shot builds, stun-lock builds, or death blight builds that can literally kill you without the enemy even hitting you. Hopefully, these issues get rebalanced soon, cause it is currently ruining PVP.

The last thing I want to talk about is the technical issues this game has experienced, and yes, I've experienced them too, and it's very disappointing to see. FPS drops and crashes are far too frequent and annoying, and while the FPS drops do seem to have been patched, for the most part, the crashes have only seemed to increase. In the past week, I have crashed 5 times, during my initial playthrough (which was 73 hours) I had only crashed twice, now I have crashed 5 times in only 20 more hours. I do see these problems getting patched with time, similar to the FPS drops, but it's still something worth mentioning.

Despite these issues, Elden Ring is fantastic, and while I would love to give it a 10, some of the problems hold it back. But don't let that deter you, I would still recommend this game, especially to die-hards of the series or even just players who enjoyed one or two FromSoftware games. To someone who has never played any of these games, I'd still give it a try, it'll be very difficult at times, but doing side stuff, leveling up, or using summons will make things much easier. FromSoftwares masterpiece and an easy recommendation.

Only performance issues I run into are stuttering here and there and connectivity issues, which will undoubtedly be fixed from From relatively soon. These issues in no way hinder my ability to play and enjoy the game. It's by far the easiest souls-like game in the series. Not that's that's a bad thing, it's just people who say the game is too difficult or the game does have x, y, or z are totally new to games of this nature and bought this game expecting something else.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"After getting so angry reading the dumb 0 and 1 star reviews, I made an account to share an honest opinion about the game. Here are my responses to the common complaints.

PC Performance.

I have had very moderate frame rate drops into the 30-40 fps range. This only happens in the open world, and only when moving between large sections. So this happens about 2% of the time during my 4-5 hour sessions. The game runs perfectly otherwise.

No ultra wide support.

This has to be the dumbest reason to give a 0 score. I could see this knocking one or two points for an average reviewer, but to give this game a 0 because there is no ultra wide support is ridiculous. Playing in 4K on a 55” OLED TV is absolutely amazing.

Empty world / boring / no story.

There is an absolutely amazing story being told in Elden Ring. From the start, you are encouraged to become essentially the queen/king of the Lands Between. The voice acting is genuine. The atmosphere and environment is very encapsulating.

Conclusion: I’m only 16 hours in and feel like I have scratched the surface of what the story is and what powers/weapons I will find. I feel like I’m playing Ocarina of Time all over again. The story there wasn’t obvious from the very beginning, and neither is it here. Just like many other open world games, until you start leveling / finding new items / and gaining new powers, you have yet to see what the game truly offers.

Absolutely 10/10. In a day where over saturated (DL2, Horizon FW) open world games are still being made, Elden Ring is a breath of fresh air that allows you to discover the world and have fun, just like the Legend of Zelda series has.",4,8
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"The game os simply overwhelming, FromSoftware is again elevating the concept",4,8
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"C'est un chef d'œuvre tout simplement. L'univers que FromSoftware à façonné est grandiose, immersif. L'exploration de la map est tellement addictif pour vous dire, j'ai passé environ 10 h à explorer l'entre de terre avant de m'attaquer au premier boss. En parlant de boss, ils sont charismatiques et bien fichus. L'architecture du château de voilorage est à en perdre la tête, il y a des recoins partout.

Pour le moment je n'ai que des petites baisse de Fps, mais rien de bien méchant donc quand je lis que le jeu est injouable, qu'il n'est pas beau, je me pose des questions ou sois on ne joue pas au même jeu.

Je pense que c'est le meilleur jeu auquel j'ai joué jusqu'à présent et j'en suis qu'au début   après 20h de jeu.

So my first hours of playtime were spent optimizing, trying out different settings both in-game and out. After a while, I decided to live with the frame drops and dive straight into it. Now, 27 hours into the game, I can say with confidence that this is one of the best games I've ever played.The amount of exploration, variety, NPC questlines, boss fights, mobs and dungeons is astonishing. Legacy dungeons are some of the best Fromsoftware has to offer and will go down in history as some of the most memorable dungeons in gaming.  There is a ton of choice in combat with many weapons and viable playstyles. Mounted combat, stealth and jumping attacks add extra layers of depth to the good old souls combat formula.All in all an enticing experience, wrapped in a beautifully crafted open world that feels much less like a checklist and offers a lot of freedom in organic gameplay approach. A 10/10 should be used on extremely rare occassions, but is without a doubt justified in this game.",4,8

If you rated this masterpiece 1 or 0 you are a totally TROLL .
Souls games are my favorites and I am  really a judging person and i can't see something bad in this game. The only problem this game has is you guys that can't get over a small problem and can't wait a little for a patch . This is not Cyberpunk.

Tech wise it has stuttering problems right now at release, but luckily for me I had almost none, it runs at solid 1440p 60fps at Ultra quality with an RTX 3070ti and Ryzen 5 5600x, for the ones who struggle with the game performance don't worry because the developer already confirmed that fixes are coming soon.",4,8
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,"I'm gonna start with the critique, then get to the compliments. My real score 80, B-, pretty good. First, after playing 20+ hours of this game I can safely say, it's a Souls game. For better or worse. I think with the hype train pulling into the station it's very clear that FromSoft has hit Pokemon/Nintendo levels in the eye of reviewer's. It feels like false advertising, as I can see most people picking this up as their first souls experience thinking there's finally one with story and accessible combat and that's just not the case. This is  FromSoft's masterpiece, but not an masterpiece of a game.Starting with the graphics, I understand that Souls games (besides Demon souls remake) usually look not great. It's the ""style"", but as the years go by theres no excuse for lazy hair cards, bad tree imposters, and truly some ugly texture work. I think this is one of the spots where you can see them resting on their laurels a bit, the overall quality is a AA studio (maybe). The foliage is some of the ugliest in games, the trees are antiquated in their design and have clear AO outlines on the leaves. They also are hyper poliginal, and lack in variation.The character is stiff and unatural still,  clearly the same rig they've had forever. I understand the whole, ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"", but it doesn't mean you can't push things forward. Blue point proved that.Lighting an open world is no easy task, and there's quite a bit of light leaks and strange artifacts but overall cudos to them on that. Combat is DS3, I do love the new additions of magic being more accessible and the ability to change weapon traits. This is the only part where I'll talk about the frame drops, it's definitely annoying, but not unplayable. It's just crazy that a game that looks like a PS3 HD remake can't coast at 60 WHEN THATS THE ONLY JOB IT HAS. Without buttery combat, Elden Ring shows the flaws of not really offering more Beyond frustrating deaths and exploration.I see that people want an ""easy mode"" or something to that effect, but I think without a strong narrative theres no real way to offer such a thing. If it existed, it would expose the places where FromSoft has always been lacking which is true narrative. An normal gamer picking up this may enjoy a bit of the dive, but it has no real meat to bite into. The game LITERALLY starts like most Souls games. You boot up, make a character, go die to hard enemy, and wake up in a new place with _insert female character_ telling you you need to reignite/reassemble _insert lightsource_. It would not shock me if they just had George R.R. Martin fill out an Mad lib they typed up. Got one of the best writers in the world, and somehow still couldn't make something unique. The game doesn't really say anything. Not all games need to, but with they way they hyped/presented it and what it actually is, it removed some of the luster immediately for me (love that slider though).As far as being an open world game, it's okay so far. I can't believe that in 2022 the praise a game has gotten for adding in an jump button, an ground mount, and literally adding nothing else to the genre. Not that it needs all the bells and whistles of other open world games, but it seems very strange. Though, Torrent is a cutie patootie and I have died to save him many times That all being said, I still love it! THANK YOU FROMSOFT! Truly, no easy feat to make a game and not easy at all to do it in a global pandemic. Time for complimentsThe music and sound design is impeccable. I actually love the overworld music and have gorgeous audio ques has actually helped me dodge attacks when the frames drop. I love the sense of urgency and adrenaline that really only monster hunter can provide besides this. The horror of exploring an area, waiting for something to pop out and keep you on edge is unparalleled. This is masterpiece for them, it highlights all the amazing design and combat that they've cultivated over the years. I would not recommend this game to most people, but I know the ones I do are gonna love it!",4,8

Sure, it has some technical issues, but I give my take with the assumption these bugs will be ironed out (their hotfixes so far have already alleviated the issues somewhat, so they're obviously committed to fixing it). I'm not even a huge Souls fan, they tend to just stress me out, although I do respect the game design. However, ER does alleviate some of the more grating aspects of the Souls formula. You can take the game at your own pace, rather than being subjected to the relentless gauntlet that these games normally tend to be. It's still very difficult in places, however, but the challenges are always surmountable.",3,6
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"The Legend of Zelda released in 1986, and served as a textbook in video game development. Most developers have forgotten that charm that makes a game, however, FromSoftware has certainly charmed me with this game. I have played well over 140 hours of Elden Ring that itself shows how massive the world is. I don't intend to criticize certain reviews that I have read, but I can only define them as invalid scoring methodology. To properly score a game you must base it off your own experience, and understand the nature of the game. Elden Ring by nature is an exploration based open world. Heck the back of the box clearly states that its exploration based open world. Negative reviews that state the game is confusing, and difficult to get around is not a reason to place a negative mark on the game. The exploration is breathtaking, and always puts me on the edge. That feeling of adrenaline is all over the place. Boss fights are challenging as expected from a souls game, but the amount of exploration will tip the scales in your favor. Elden Ring pushes players to gear, level and learn the mechanics of the game. Most bosses are well designed, and game contains many secrets.
Negatives of the game definitely some framerate drops or crashing during launch for PC, but these things happen. That charm that captivated gamers in The Legend of Zelda was the sense of  exploration. Most games today hold your hand in the beginning, but Elden Ring plops you right in the world. I understand that most gamers are nurtured to start with receiving straight forward objectives, and having a game that puts you in the world with no objectives is overwhelming. Elden Ring purpose is to pique gamers' sense of curiosity. Making gamers curious about the world and mechanics promotes higher level thinking. This is the reason why Elden Ring definitely is considered a masterpiece.",3,6
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Great Game, great Soulslike. One of the best open world structure on the market and an amazing exemple of storytelling.

"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,"The Evolution of Open World Game Design.

I’ll start right to the point: Elden Ring is an excellent game, but the PC version is not the best it should be, simple as that.

The PC version of Elden Ring needs a bit of love and care: it’s a shame that, as of the day of posting this review, the game still suffers from shader chaching issues, or possibly asset streaming problems…maybe both; whatever it is, for some PC setups and users the problem is bigger and more noticeable than for others. For me…it’s alright, because it seems the more I play, the less frequently said issues occur, and overall the experience is not tarnished much by it, for me : )

Now, on the actual bad design aspects in the PC version: the Menu Navigation is a pain, because it has some hardcoded keys, like Q, E, etc.; Sometimes we’ll need to press Q to go back a menu, while in other occasions it’s just the expected ESC key. That is poor design, and lack of proper testing with people used to play PC games.

Secondly, Camera Movement and Target Selection are awful on Mouse and Keyboard. The target lock and camera reset actions are bound to the same key, with no option to decouple them, for starters, and idem for the dash and dodge/roll keys, same crap.
With both my DualShock 4 and Dualsense Controllers, the game play as expected from a gamepad, no way to officially show Playstation buttons, though (only with mods), a minor issue anyway.

I understand certain developers from other companies / games have been publicly criticizing Elden Ring lack of proper User Experience (“UX”, if you will), but that’s not exactly what I’m talking about here, or at least not in the same manner: those developers are a disgrace to their respective companies and should rethink their words next time…because their games aren’t exactly the prime examples of marvelous UI/UX design, either, I’ve played all of them, I know.

There’s stuff to be improved for this PC version but, with that said…yeah, what’s left after going past those issues is an incredible video game that teaches very important lessons in Open World Design, which I hope some other studios learn from and get inspired by.
This concept has always been there and used in some video game franchises, in the past, which we have now seen evolve, in some of their recent titles as well.

What Elden Ring does, is just taking all the great aspects of their previous games, and expand it into this great open world they’ve crafted for us.

I’m not a veteran of the Souls Series at all, but I’ve played all kinds of games since the 90s, and I don’t feel a game being less hand-holding on me is a problem…it just makes me feel more free to do whatever I want and, If I mess up and die…I die, and learn, then repeat but, in the process, I have fun, because no matter what I do…I’m learning, exploring, discovering.

I think this design fits perfectly for such an Open World game, it does, it works and I like it.

On the Performance side of things, the game is locked at 60 FPS, which is another aspect I’d like to see improved, but not as crucial as the other poorly designed stuff previously mentioned; More importantly, frame-pacing feels off, especially because the game’s FPS limiter is not good enough, and also the game locks itself at 60 Hz on Fullscreen, so I recommend playing in Borderless if your screen supports higher Refresh Rates.
I’ve been playing at 1620p DLDSR, on a Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti, and FPS are normally as close to 60 as possible, sometimes in the low 50s in certain demanding areas, all while at Maximum Settings.

I’m eager to see what Ray Traced effects they implement on a future update, because currently stuff like the SSAO and Shadows are quite poor in places, especially SSAO has this while halo / overlay around objects that are also close to a water surface, and Shadows flicker quite a lot, especially distant shadows / from vegetation.

The Story requires a lot of exploring and talking to different important characters to even begin to comprehend the basics of what’s happening, but I love that because it makes me want to play more, and leaves a good part to the user’s interpretation.

There’s not a lot of voice acting, compared to other games, but the actors do a great job with their performances.

And the Graphics, while not being the most photo-realistic ones we’ve ever seen…well who cares? When the game looks so gorgeous anyway, because its artistic design and atmosphere are really top notch. So many areas in the game leave me speechless, with how beautiful they look, and I wish this game had an official Photo Mode…oh, please, we need one (I know, there’s a good one with third party tools, but this should be a standard feature in these huge games).

An easy 10/10 if the issues ever get fixed, for now…a bit lower from me, but still an excellent game nonetheless.",3,6
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Elden Ring has an incredible number of fascinating locations to explore and cool enemies to fight. The developer studio has refined the precision of combat over their past five games, and it still feels so good to outmaneuver dangerous foes.

The music and art direction are as beautiful and powerful as ever before. They really do most of the work to set the tone for an epic adventure with a dramatic finale.

Elden Ring is more accessible than any Dark Souls game. Example #1: Stakes of Marika allow players to revive closer to the boss arenas and get back to the action quicker. Example #2: The mount in this game spawns out of thin air and moves through the open world faster than the normal movement speed. Example #3: Spirit ashes enable a variety of NPC summons to be upgraded, and they make boss fights a lot easier. Example #4: Invasions only happen when you voluntarily interact with the online summons. They do not happen randomly in the open world. Example #5: Fast travel is more convenient than before. All of these quality-of-life improvements make Elden Ring more enjoyable for the average player by cutting out some of the tedium.

However, not everyone has to play it. I think the developers of Elden Ring still want to target a semi-specific audience. If you like franchises in the fantasy genre such as Final Fantasy, God of War, The Elder Scrolls, The Lord of the Rings, and A Game of Thrones, then you might have fun playing Elden Ring.

Be warned that people should not buy Elden Ring just based on the hype alone and expect to love it if they were never truly interested in the first place. Dying often is a natural part of From Software games, and it requires patience and perseverance to earn the euphoria of defeating a powerful boss. Overcoming the difficulty and marveling at the visual effects provides an addicting feeling that keeps players coming back.

The lack of certain features, like a pause function and a quest log, are only minor inconveniences in the grand scheme of the whole game. In fact, the game developers may have intended to promote more natural exploration through these design choices. And the map has just enough details to generate more curiosity without feeling like a burdensome checklist. Players will spend less time looking at the menus and more time actually immersed in the world of The Lands Between.

I think my friends could have a great time with Elden Ring if they persevere through the difficulty because the cooperative play with strangers has been a blast so far.

Visual stuttering can a serious issue, but it happens rarely. Its effect on the game-play is usually negligible. (Everyone seems to be experiencing different degrees of performance issues, regardless of the quality of their computers.) My personal experience has no freezes and no crashes. Please realize a high review score does not mean the game is perfect. A high score means that the person gave their highest recommendation.",3,6

"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"I'm a huge Fromsoft fan, Elden Ring has overtaken Bloodborne as my favorite game of all time. Elden Ring is like they took great things from all of their other games and melded them into one, but also made it open world and bumped the quality from 10 to 11. The combat is basically DS3 but better, which is great. BB and Sekiro still have better combat though. The world design is their best ever, the side characters are their best ever. The boss design is mostly on par with their best imo. There are like 5 bosses that contend with my all time favorites from the other games. The open world is probably the best I've experienced. Also has the best QOL features by far.

I do still have some complaints though. There is a lot of boss reusing, but its 99% in side content so I don't really mind. Some boss attacks are kinda BS. And theres a lot of group/gank bosses that are very obnoxious, mostly in side content but there is one story one in particular that everyone despises.",3,6
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Small Stutters and framerate issues were mostly fixed with the latest patch, but still persist in some cases.
Other than that the game is a masterpiece, taking everything Fromsoftware learned from their previous titles and translating it perfectly into an open world. Of course some bosses are copy pasted to some locations, but even then it feels rewarding to explore the vast open world. The main bosses are the best designed and likely hardest in the series (excluding maybe some Sekiro bosses).",3,6

"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"I have no idea why Elden Ring has so many negative user reviews for PC.  I hesitated buying the game because of all the negativity, but I'm so glad I decided to try it for myself.

The game is objectively amazing - incredibly well-designed gameplay and progression that enables users to find a playstyle to match the level of difficulty they want. The world is engaging, huge, intricate, and beautiful. This is my first souls-like game, and I found it to be approachable without feeling overwhelming. Its design stands alone from almost all other open-world games, with minimal hand-holding in order to cultivate a feeling of mystery, intrigue, and danger. I'm finding myself engrossed in a way that reminds me of my time playing Skyrim for the first time a decade ago (albeit with much more dying, better RPG elements, better open world, better enemy variety, better challenges, and thinner story).

The performance issues are WAY overblown. Does it have occasional stuttering? Yes. Does it lack ultrawide support out of the box? Yes. Does either significantly detract from my enjoyment of the game? Not at all. Plus, there's already mods available to unlock framerate and add UW support, so I wouldn't base your decision on the overblown performance complaints you may have seen.

Overall it's at least a 9/10 for me. If they can optimize performance and find a way to improve FPS &amp; reduce stuttering, it probably deserves a 10.",3,6
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,"Equipo: i7, 8GB RAM DDR4, GTX 1050 2GB, SSD. 1900x1080 (Medio/Alto).
Rendimiento: Bastante bueno y fluido a excepción de las zonas más exigentes donde se dieron puntuales caídas a 20 fps (sólo en calidad alta).
Horas en completar la primera partida: 50 horas.
Dificultad: Es al mismo tiempo el más fácil y el más difícil de todos los juegos de From Software. Incluye zonas de dificultad irrisoria frente a enemigos absurdamente difíciles e injustos (Comparado con los estándares de From Software).
Bugs y Fallos: En toda la partida sólo encontré un fallo cuando el caballo se quedó atascado en un sitio. En 50 horas el juego se salió al escritorio un total de 15 o 20 veces (Situaciones al azar. Ninguna acción en concreto provocaba errores. Seguramente problema del PC). El error más común era que el caballo y algunos enemigos se volvían invisibles en algunos momentos. No muy molesto y nunca con jefes o enemigos únicos.

Elden Ring coge toda la experiencia acumulada por From Software hasta la fecha y lo combina en un juego titánico con guiños e inspiración tomados de los juegos anteriores de la compañía. Al que más se parece en mecánicas y desarrollo del PJ, a mi modo de ver, es a DS3.

Sin embargo, más es menos en este caso. El vasto mundo se hace abrumador y pesado por momentos y al estar tan lleno de contenido pierde la épica única de los juegos anteriores. En Elden Ring no encontraremos enemigos capaces de dejar huella como Father Gascoigne, Lady Butterfly o  Sister Friede. Por el contrario Elden Ring incluye enemigos difíciles pero planos: barras de vida enormes, daño absurdo, demasiados ataques ineludibles, de área o capaces de matar de un golpe; cualidades que a mi modo de ver no hacen un buen combate. En Sekiro, por ejemplo, los combates eran endiabladamente difíciles pero a la vez brindaban un duelo justo donde lo único que influía era la habilidad del jugador. Elden Ring sin embargo está plagado de muertes injustas y absurdas incluso para el mundo al que nos tiene acostumbrados Miyazaki.

Se recomienda su compra: Sí, incluso por 40 o 50 euros pero matizando que antes de comprar Elden Ring considero que DS3, Sekiro o Bloodborne son mejores inversiones en caso de no haberlos jugado con anterioridad.

Por último para aquellos que encontréis los juegos de FS muy difíciles o queráis trastear y probar diferentes personajes o armas siempre podéis utilizar WeMod y Cheat Engine (IMPORTANTE: Nunca uses cheats o mods en una partida real de un juego de From Software o serás baneado.

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"I remember playing Morrowind for a year and a half back in 2003. I loved exploring that world. It felt like there was something new behind every corner and it kept me really invested. Then, after Oblivion was announced I patiently waited for almost 3 years for a new great adventure. When it was finally released in 2006, I woke up early and rushed to the store to buy it. After coming home and installing it, I was beyond excited. About 30 minutes later, when I exited the starting dungeon and got to the open world, it felt fantastic. That's exactly how Elden Ring felt after Dark Souls III.So far, it's everything I expected and even more. The open world exceeded my expectations by a lot. Insane variety of locations, enemies, spells, weapons and so on. At the moment of this review I'm 30 hours in, but I already feel like I experienced the density of 3 modern open-world games. The only game I can remember that had such a wonderful open world was Red Dead Redemption 2. So, that's definitely says something.I see a lot of reviews comparing it to the modern open world RPGs like Horizon Forbidden West and Assassin's Creed Valhalla. I don't think that's a fair comparison at all. Both of them are fine, but they're using the same open world formula that was around for years. They have insane amount of handholding that takes away your freedom in favor of smooth and painless experience. FromSoftware games are simply not like that. They designed to give you all much freedom as possible. Including adjusting the difficulty and discovering the story by yourself. In my opinion, this kind of approach is the golden standard that puts ""open"" in the ""open world"".However, there are 2 reasons why it currently has 6.4 average user score:1. The game suffers from frame drops and stuttering. Not a deal breaker, but can be annoying if you're sensitive to it. I'm sure it will be patched eventually, but currently it isn't.2. Elden Ring had the heaviest marketing campaign of any FromSoftware game. As a result, a lot of new people came around and some of them are not really understanding what is it all about. That includes Ubisoft and EA fans.",3,6

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"The games score at time of writing (6.1) is a demonstration of how overly obsessed people have become with graphical fidelity over every other aspect of game design. Yes, this game does have some performance issues. it is also, in almost every other way, a masterful piece of art that prioritizes artistic design and quality gameplay over stuffing itself with pointless busywork.

The open world itself is fantastically made, filled to the brim with quality content that exists as more than a time killer or a space filler; it's well thought out, tightly executed content.

The changes that have been made to the souls formula help to elevate the game, working in tandem with the open world to provide a greater sense of exploration and discovery than any other Fromsoft game.

In brief, this game is a well thought out, beautifully realized gem. It uses its open world to benefit its gameplay and its design instead of using it as an excuse for mediocre content. That gem just so happens to have a bit of dirt on it.

I don't like to be confrontational, and it's completely fair to not enjoy the game. However, if some graphical issues are enough for you to give a game this well designed and beautifully realized a 0/10, please re-evaluate your metrics.",3,6

It combines aspects of open world Games and rpg mechanics better than many other action rpgs. Fair warning the game is not for everyone as it requires a lot of time spending to learn its mechanics.

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"On PC I've had few of the problems, from my own looking into the problems it seems the problems are only with the highest end computers not the mid range computers like mine. On the game play it feels like a more refined and expanded Dark Souls 3, so for those familiar with From Soft think better DS3 with a massive open world.
For anyone not familiar with the games, this is a game that takes time and skills that you'll learn by playing, from boss moves and when to attack, roll/jump to not get hit. When playing there's always a way to avoid damage but learning how to get around it will take time. That's to say the ""Get good"" meme is actually the advice due to every play-style being just as viable as each other, but ultimately Elden Ring just like the other Souls-born games they aren't easy games that everyone will be able to just pick up, but if you have the time and patience you can get good enough to go the whole game never taking damage at level 1.",3,6

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"After spending 80+ hours in this game, there are many things I have noticed it choses not to do, and in the process makes the game more enjoyable because of this.

This is a great intro to the Souls genre that deconstructs the open-world genre and asks the question: Is this really necessary for gameplay, or does this ruin the experience by design?

By taking a minimalistic approach to assisting the player, the game gives you the agency to make any choice and explore any path. However, the game also provides ""guiding grace"" to give you direction if you chose to play the game in a linear fashion. This separation of exploration and objective is fundamental to open world games and yet so many restrict large amounts of exploration behind multiple meaningless objectives, gates, or levels which hinder player immersion.

Instead, by nudging the player through difficulty and death, you learn how to experience the game and succeed, and that's why I enjoy this game.

That is to say it is not without it's flaws:

It makes the assumption you have played video games and understand how gameplay in a exploration game works. It makes the assumption human stubbornness is limited and that players will make the objectively better choice to explore and return rather than continue and become frustrated. The lore can sometimes be limited and only explained through items, though depending on who you ask the mystery is half of the enjoyment.

Some critical NPCs that can make the game much easier are just randomly hidden away, for you to find in the first area (spirit summoning, ashes of war seller). This makes melee gameplay harder if you miss them. Spellcasters and prayer teachers are much more abundant and ends up leading to a playstyle where going purely with combat leads to more unintended difficulty than being a little bit of both blade and spell/prayer. Skills (ashes of war) do a decent job offsetting this issue, but they are not easily acquired though are great after acquiring.

It also is not well optimized for PC, dropping frames when loading between areas and during some sequences.

Visually it is semi-dated, but its scenery and framing make the world look like so much more than it is, you hardly ever end up noticing the fine details due to to gorgeous views and sprawling architecture, all of which, yes, you can get there, yes, you can explore. The vertical enormity of the game makes its smaller overall map feel massive and full of places to explore. Best of all, not being able to climb restricts you but also motivates you to reach places you have yet to explore. I have stopped for many moments just to take in the view and appreciate the world I am exploring. (""Gorgeous view ahead"" indeed!)

Overall I give this game a 9.5/10 for its excellent gameplay and the overall experience. I loved every moment I had with it, and can easily see myself replaying it on New Game +",3,6

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,"It's appropriately difficult, open world, dark &amp; gloomy and has a plethora of weapons, skills and classes to choose from. From my perspective, the multiplayer portion of the game is integrated in such a way that you never feel disconnected from the community, even if you're running solo. It's possible to summon friends to your world, leave messages for other players, and engage in PvP by invading another person world.

My only gripes would be the lack of a free camera (it auto resets itself, minor, but annoying), and far too many people are reporting performance inadequacies; but these can be easily addressed.",3,6

It's probably the best game I've ever played and I have already over 100 hours.The gameflow, gameplay, combat is perfection. They took the best from all souls games and created a magnum opus in terms of combat.The enemys/bosses and areas are so amazing and detailed that I am still stunned when I look at it.Cinematics are awesome too and it has so much good content, that it blew my mind.The quests and story is also wonderful and I was never more into a game as Elden Ring overall. Definetely a 10/10.Now lets talk about the current ""controvery"":Some Game devs (Especially the sore loosers at ubisoft) badmouthed this game with various untrue reasons like: missing UI, bad graphics, overhyped by game critics and so on (,while being unable to make good games theirself).Saddest part is, that some ubi-fanboys are reviewbombing this game and giving their favourite ""open world game"" perfect score. They usually copy ubisofts and over devs words and just add the ""bad performance"" part for PC, which mostly has been fixed for people above min. reqiurements.If you don't like it or even hate the game, I guess it's okay if you give like a 5. But it shouldn't be objectively possible to give below 5 because it's in every aspect amazing. Now to all the Fanboys/Clowns: If you really hate it, it's okay. Taste is objective.If you think the game is bad because of gameplay or graphics then you didn't know what game you bought in the first place and you are a fool.If the game doesn't run smoothly, next time read the System requirements, which they posted like 1 week even before release.If you cry about UI, lore or just copy the stupid/false words from the ""devs"", just go to your corner and play your easy/boring/bad microtransaction games with 800 questmarker/waypoints on the map where you just follow a path like a bot without thinking/playing yourself. If that's the case, you are the reason why gaming gets bad and gives money to those big ""triple A"" companys, who exploit clowns like you.If you want to fight me in an argument about this, just add me on steam or write me a comment there.

However, because of the amount of exposure this game has gotten its received purchases from all over the gaming sphere, players from every type of background have gotten their hands on this game and it shows. Well the game is challenging, it isn't impossible, and never tries to surprise you in the progression or game design of boss fights and so on. The problem seems to stem from players' ability to learn new tactics, read the menus and understand what they're capable of in gameplay. Many don't want to take on these new challenges or learn new things so you end up with a user score like we have right now. I've seen so complaints they could simply be solved if people would just read and try to understand what they want to do with their builds.

Some of the cons in this game mostly are to due to their dx12 implementation on PC, the game struggles with shader buffers, and while you play for the first time, every time you encounter new textures and effects you have a change of stutters. These stutters can only happen once on the first time they're loaded so over longer play sessions you will experience them less and less. I'm inclined to believe this will be fixed, but it is frustrating to encounter this stuttering during boss fights.

If you enjoy challenges and have a healthy ability to take a loss and improve the holes in your game, this game hands down is one of the best experiences you'll play.",3,6

Regarding the game, it is intentionally obscure with very little hand holding outside of the five minute tutorial dungeon.

The world is dense enough that exploring is fun with many hidden little places to discover.

Quests are hidden away in the world and obscure enough that you can walk right by them if you aren't paying attention.

The combat is deep and satisfying, it has built on every previous FromSoftware game and is as tight as ever.

The game is much more accessible than any previous souls games and the difficulty is fairly smooth with only sharp spikes in and around major boss fights.

The meta of the game seems to be to anger the player by any means necessary and really they just do this without reprieve, using every dirty trick in the book. Example, there is a new Lobster mob that can shoot at you with pinpoint accuracy from miles away, taking out nearly half your HP with one shot. I've had enough of that nonsense. It's cute but it doesn't serve a purpose other than to be a nuisance when you're exploring.

Noteworthy combat encounters are rare, Dungeons are few and far between, even fewer of them containing items of value. I was mostly sad to find out that it lacked the sense of accomplishment i felt in Dark Souls after beating a boss. I killed nearly all of the Lords and i just felt bored.

Control mapping is weak on PC, can get really confusing in time sensitive situations. I don't like playing with a controller but it really was made for consoles in mind, so instead of using a button per action sometimes you'll have to combine two. Latency is also weird sometimes, like the commands activate late or not at all.

Most infuriating though, it's filled to the brim with hackers and it hasn't even been two weeks since it came out. FS still tone-deaf to the pleas of the community.

My advice is get it after the hype dies down, or after it gets a few well deserved patches.",2,4

The issues with the game right now for me is coop. It's very janky, sometimes works, sometimes just doesn't. Constant DC's but when it works, its damn fun. Play mostly solo so it's not too big a deal but if your looking for a game that is bang for your buck, this is it. Not sure if it will be your thing if you don't like souls games. Personally I'm not really a souls players. I dabbled in all of them for probably a combined 50 ish hours or so but I absolutely love this game. I'm addicted to it and cant stop playing so I would say challenge yourself. It's quite the experience. Doesn't hold your hand and doesn't give a F**k about your feelings.

If you follow the correct pathway set for your character building you will enjoy the end result. Is it a challenging game? Absolutely. The game is designed for people who want to explore a new world and build their character for their play style. I can only say one moment that was disheartening and that was a player invader who killed me over and over, basically griefing me and making my game not fun. There is a way out of this invasion though. When you get to resting place at fire simply move to a different area on map.

The ambiance is so captivating, the architecture and landscapes are breathtaking, the setting, the way things are presented, how small you feel before the challenges that you face and before the environment, it makes this adventure feel epic.

That's why the game is somewhat highly rated. A long-awaited game. Personally, I can't say that it fully met my expectations. It also did not disappoint. Let's take a look at the good sides of the game. The game partially meets Dark Souls. It has a nice game design, although it has some missing parts. It promises a long playtime. Open world trial successful. Let's move on to the bad parts of the game. It definitely,  as a 3A game has poor graphics for its release year.
It has optimization issues and sometimes it affects gameplay badly. While the open world was partially successful, it was too simplistic and inadequate. It's a bit difficult to compare compared to Dark souls games. Because the boss designs and schematics look a bit amateurish. Although the game difficulty seems to be simplified a bit, the open world is extremely time-consuming and the main focus of the game, the bosses, is not very attractive. There are tons of problems I've encountered after 50 hours of gameplay. I just played it like a new Dark Souls game. This gave me some pleasure. Many people have had problems with the game controls, which should be taken into account. In short, the game seems a little early released to me.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"In my new souls fan recently opinion (I've just only played DS1, 3, Sekiro):
1. Advantages:
- About Gameplay is drawn from previous games, less stamina cost, you can teleport without required sitting in the bonfire (lost grave) but not of that the game is easier cause the bosses are adjusted challenging similar to previous games. Visual art, dark atmosphere, environmental sounds, story-telling, it's just strangely beautiful, it plunges me into a dark fantasy world.
2. Disadvantages:
- Admittedly, optimization is really bad, fps drop happens quite often, low to medium setting is not much different, i hope in the future FromSoftware will release more patch to fix this.

This is a game that reminds me of a real sense of adventure since the last time I played Skyrim. Like I said, the above is just my opinion, no matter how many different opinions, I still enjoy this game.
* And i have an advice for you, who spent time to read my opinion:

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,Launch was kinda rough for a lot of people. The game ran fine for me and I can without a doubt say that it is the best game I have ever played - a solid 10/10.,2,4
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"I love this game! I've already sunk in over 25 hours since launch.

It is frustratingly hard, but it feels like next time you have it for sure, over and over hahahaha.

I started out as a Wretch class, with no previous Souls-like game experience. I died like 10 times to the first creature (a wolf) I found but I loved it! It felt so fresh and exciting. Slowly finding new weapons, skills, abilities was so fun and rewarding.

This game would be a great game to stream, so many random ways to die, so many stupid mistakes.

I would have given it a 10 but there are some graphical freezes/issues that, while I notice them, aren't game killing for me.. yet.",2,4

"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,2,"Playing this game made me think again about dark souls 2, now i call it a masterpiece",2,4
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"I have just finished the game for the second time, once as a full caster build and once as a full strength build, so I think I can finally say that yes, I definitely do recommend Elden Ring.

This is without a doubt FROM's most accessible game ever, you can tell they've put a lot of effort into the new player experience. They have also added a ton of quality of life changes which are very welcome even to a veteran player. That's not to say the game is easier though, because it's not, and some bosses are without a doubt some of the most challenging they've ever created.

The move to open world was risky but I would say it paid off for the most part, although the game being so open and especially vertical did make for some frustrating moments when you were left thinking ""how the hell do I get over there?"", and sometimes the answer was extremely convoluted.

The gameplay feels fresher than ever, with more ways to play and more viable builds. Magic has never felt so good, even a little too good at times. You also have weapon ashes which are like weapon special moves which add a ton of customisation to your build. On top of all that you have Incarnations which are like spells but more holy (faith) focused. There are many end-game builds which are all very different and all viable, which gives the game a lot of replayability. And speaking of replayability, you'll almost certainly want to do at least a second playthrough as you will miss a ton unless you're following a guide, it's impossible not to as the game has so much content that is off the beaten patch.

So far I have been extremely positive but the game isn't perfect and the issues need to be brought up. First and foremost the game suffers from stuttering, regardless of your hardware, this is a fundamental game issue and you will experience it (whether you'll notice it or not is a different matter). If you are sensitive to performance problems you will definitely notice this issue as it's very prevalent in certain areas. The online co-op is also massively broken, you will be met with ""unable to summon co-operator"" errors all the time, it doesn't work more often than it does, so if you're planning to play with friends or just like to summon help from random players you may have a bad time. The later portion of the game is also a bit of a let-down, with several of the bosses being overwhelming difficult, as a veteran I struggled, so if this is your first time playing a FROM game just prepare yourself for the fact the difficultly dials up to 11 very rapidly towards the end, more so than any other FROM game. I also found the final boss extremely underwhelming, I won't spoil it but it's not a fun fight IMO.

For the most part the game is a massive success, the amount of content is unbelievable, the world they've created is gorgeous, thematically the bosses are incredible and it has never been easier to jump into a FROM title. Most of the issues can be fixed, but only time will tell if they are. The bottom line is, if you're a fan of FROM games you will love Elden Ring, and if you're not, there has never been a better time to jump in as a new player.",1,2

Von der Story über Gameplay bis hin zum Welt-, Boss- und Dungeondesign ist alles stimmig.

Die Kämpfe sind anspruchsvoll und doch gib es Builds und Mechaniken, die es auch ungeschickten Spielern erlauben die Story genießen und Fortschritt machen zu können.

Die schlechten Rezensionen über, wirklich minimale, Micro-FPS freezings und 60FPS-capping, usw. lassen wieder tief in die Wohlstandsgesellschaft blicken und verraten mehr über den Rezensenten als über das Spiel.",1,2
"Mar 17, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,Elden Ring has an absolute gorgeous world to explore and it never feels copy paste like so many open world games. The boss design is top notch and the customization options are absolutely insane! Whenever you get stuck on a fight you can now take a breather and go and do something else to train and better equip yourself. You never truly get blocked in. I haven't had much performance issues but I've seen some that have. This is honestly the best adventure game I've ever played and it definitely deserves to be held up high and shown as a great example of what gaming can be.,1,2
"Mar 17, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,Elden Ring is phenomenal for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the Soulsborne series. It does have a heavy learning curve and  can frustrate newer players but give it a chance and hopefully you will also see how amazing this game really is.,1,2
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"This game is absolutely amazing, exploring never gets boring as there's always something new to see or do. The game has multiple huge optional areas and engaging things that can keep you playing for hours. It's also extremely immersive, I haven't felt this since my first playthrough of Dark Souls 1. It has creative bosses, fun exploration, cool side quests, a HUGE map, and much more. I highly recommend this game to everyone, even if you aren't experienced with a fromsoftware game before.",1,2
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,7,"Since I'm playing on PC it's only justified that I write a review for the PC version. Elden Ring is a beautiful vast open world with plenty of things to explore and bosses to fight but at the same time it just feels so empty. Following the same format of the previous Souls games you are thrown into a barren world bent on a task to restore order.

There is nothing new or different about this game when compared to the other games released by FromSoftware. Sure you have a vast open world to explore which is new but the world just feels empty, don't you think that with doing a open world you might have thought about adding in a passive fort or village fighting just to make the world seem more lively. There are a few NPC's to be found throughout the world, some of which have quests to give but don't expect the game to tell you where to go for that quest. in all my 45+ hours of playing I have come across just one quest marker and that was to show me where to find a portal, other than that you better either be taking some notes or scrounging the wiki for the answer on where to go next.

The variety of bosses in this game is great, some optional and some mandatory to continue the main story. The music is phenomenal with my favorite being during the Ancestor Spirit Boss Fight, that fight alone just reminds me of The Dancer fight from DS3, not as hard but just as wonderful and graceful. This is the perfect game for any newcomer to the series to start off with just because of how the open world provides a sort of play at your own pace feel to it.

With as good as this game is though it's not without it's issues, I can't even begin to count the amount of times I have died due to stuttering or random FPS drops, the game is locked at 60 FPS which is fine but when it just randomly drops to 15 FPS it can be a bit jarring. Beyond that I've had my game crash on me a couple time and had a few enemies break to where they just start spinning.

This game is fun, don't get me wrong. It's not deserving of a 0 but also not deserving of a 10. Down to it's core it's just another Dark Souls Game and nothing new.",1,2
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Very good game. Essentially dark souls mechanics / items / quests stuffed inside of a BOTW style open world. It's fun to alternate grinding/exploring/dungeons. A lot to do in every single region, lots of interesting minibosses, sidequests, and general fun exploring. The open world does not feel copy and pasted like other open world games i've played.

A lot of people are complaining about the graphics, but i completely disagree and think this game looks fine. Would much rather sacrifice graphics for good gameplay eitherway.

I think with the PC performance issues this deserves a 9/10, but giving 10/10 to combat the ridiculous 0 score bombs.",1,2
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,6,"Out of the 70 or so bosses i have fought, only a handful of them were memorable for being enjoyable. I really struggle to think of too many others. There are a number of threads that explain the grievances of this games boss design as well as general design far better than I can. The amount of reskinned, duo, infinitely aggressive bosses that I’ve trudged through never gave me the same satisfaction as a title such as DS1 or bloodborne. The godskin duo boss is a shining example of a problem. Also Fire Giant? Apart from the fight (I use melee) being “I hope I can track him down In time to land a hit” is not exactly exhilarating for such a late game boss. It just feels like delayed attack, AoE attacks, repeated. Also, the amount of dragon fights, Jesus Christ. My biggest complaint is repetition. The dungeons, ruins, a good amount of bosses, and some story points all feel like I’ve they’ve been beating me over the head with them. I have a number of complaints and praises about this game and as someone who’s near 100%’ed all of FROMs previous titles I don’t believe it’s a skill issue. I just feel a little disappointed.",1,2
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Best game I have ever played. Beautiful world, great story and amazing gameplay. Only thing holding it back are the performance issues on PC. Otherwise a near perfect game.",1,2
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,6,"It's an ok game. But it barely works.
It keeps on stuttering and freezing, sometimes it doesn't even start remaining on a white screen forever. This situation makes some enemies impossible to beat, just because the game crumbles on itself when you are near them.
The fighting system is annoying and unfair for the player, to make an example: if you manage to knock an enemy to the ground it becomes invincible and you can't attack them. You would guess that the same goes for you, but no. If you get knocked down you receive a combo that kills you.
The major bosses almost instakill you after one hit. The magic system is overpowered, and doing a parry is almost pointless because the combo that you can do after the parry, does the same damage that you would do with a charged attack. To make everything worse it's extremely hard to do because you can't understand when the enemies hit you. ( this is especially true for the major bosses ). Also, there are a lot of attacks that aren't parry-able, and there is no prompt or indication that they can't be parried. The mechanic of blocking the attacks is really interesting because you can follow it with a combo. But it is doable only on small enemies because after a boss combo you don't have enough stamina left to attack, and instead receive an attack in your face.
The game feels generally old and every animation, every weapon, every combo has a feel of ""already seen"".
If you go to an advanced area and beat an enemy that would have killed you in two hits, you receive the same exp that you would get beating the same enemy in his weaker version, in the starting zone. It is completely mental because advancing in the game, you need progressively more exp to level up, but the enemies give you always the same amount, even the harder ones.
The game gives you the illusion to have the possibility to fuse a lot of styles, magics, weapons, armors, and abilities. But in reality, the only sensible ones reduce to a number countable with your fingers. This is especially true for armors, which are incredibly useless to one another, with really small chances between them and just a couple of them being really useful. I didn't understand the weight mechanic... between ""medium-weight"" and ""light-weight"" changes literally nothing. Moving speed is the same, attack speed is the same, you roll in the same way...
The soundtrack is ok, nothing special. I've played dozens of hours and I can't recall even one track... so yeah, they work, but nothing memorable.
The ""new"" mechanics are also annoying. The jump is utterly pointless because in the open world you can jump essentially nowhere, resolving in the end always using your mount jump. In a ""closed"" environment instead, it just becomes a way to give you anxiety and frustration. It opens new possibilities to explore the environment and have smart shortcuts, but the majority of them are on a freefall down, which in this game means INSTANT death. It wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that you respawn at the last checkpoint, and even if you manage to survive all the enemies on the road to get where you died, you could just slip down one of the platforms and LOSE ALL THE EXP you have collected to that moment. ( which could be a lot since going further in the game, you start to require something like 25.000 runes to level up ONE level; and the enemies give you around 150 runes average ).
This could be acceptable if the jump mechanic was implemented decently in the game. But that isn't the case, the jump is hard to calibrate and sometimes unpredictable.

I would recommend this game if you like exploration and BIG boss battles. Those are two points in which this game excels, It doesn't even seem the same game. Weird is... the game usually stutters less on the big bosses compared to the small ones. Also, being the Big B.s big you can challenge them also on your mount. Which is super satisfying. The exploration is always interesting and pretty much diverse even tho the story is comparable to a headache and is really confused.

Overall it isn't a bad game. but not a good one either.
It has its very good things, but sadly it also has HUGE negative and annoying things.

P.S. during frame drops, enemies are literally invisible.",1,2

"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Hate seeing this anywhere below atleast a 9. But it's an easy 10/10 for me. I created an account just to help this game's ratings. I'm 80 hours in and I can safely say it's the best game I've ever played. As a 30 year old man, it makes me feel like a kid again, even just thinking about playing it after work! If we are comparing games, this is objectively a 10/10. So majestical and mysterious. Dark cosmic horror mixed with open world medieval buildings. Different enemies, different locations, it just never gets old. I honestly don't know how I'm ever gonna play another ""Ubisoft like"" title again. The industry better step it's game up! Fingers crossed.",1,2
"Mar 17, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Elden ring is perhaps the best soulsborne game, they took everything from there titles and put it into elden ring. The lore and story is quite interesting, bosses are pretty cool and awesome looking. I really do like the horse torrent you acquire, horseback battle is simple but makes some fights easier and some harder. Overall this is an amazing game and might be my favorite out of all FS games.
Cons: Currently there are problems with the pc problem like stuttering, freezing, etc. M+K is bad but its a souls game, why arent you using a gamepad. Netcode is really buggy. It will disconnect a cooperator or invader randomly and quite often, like maybe 7/10 it will do it.
All in all, once issues have been fixed, i recommend you should try this game, but its a difficult games and if you dont enjoy challenging games then maybe it isnt for you.",1,2

"Mar 17, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"My pc satisfies the minimum requests parameters to play the game and since I started to play I had only 3 soft frame rate drops (I play with max graphic settings), the game is perfectly beautiful in all of his aspects. I don't have all that problems the people critices so in my opinion this is a 10/10",1,2
"Mar 17, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Technical-performance:
There were some minor technical issues at lauch (for me at least).I've not experienced any stutterings however there were small fps drops but it was very rare and only in huge open world areas.I've played at maximum settings in 1440p. My Rig is 3060ti+i7 9700K /2x8GB ram 3200Mhz and standard Crucial MX500 SSD. Generally my GPU was not stressed and was operating around 60-70% the drops were VERY rare in 90h of playing i've seen less then 10 times where fps was down below 60.I find it perfectly acceptable it's a lot better than for example God Of War was at launch earlier this year.

Plot &amp; World:
Plotline is shrouded in mystery basic FromSoftware unless you really dig into it you will have some bare idea what is going on ;) . World is massive there is no other way about it. Where Sekiro was too small in my opinion this game is enormous to the extreme the amount of bosses/NPC/Hidden Areas etc is staggering. It took me 90h to explore most of it kill major bosses collect items for achievemnts etc. and that is only single playthrough considering there are 3 endings it just shows how much of content there is.

Graphics &amp; Audio

From graphical standpoint the game is nothing special (not to say it's bad or anything) it's as expected though anyone who played any FromSoftware game is aware that they never rly stressed that part of game for me personally graphics are acceptable though some textures could use some more loving in 2022.Audio on the other hand is excellent as always the soundtrack from the game is great and creates some very climatic boss battles.

Gameplay:
Basically the Dark Souls system is back with additions.Those are:
-Spirit Ashes - which are basically ghost summons that help you out.
-Ashes of War - An enchant on weapons granting special abilites
-Some new attacks like jumping attacks ,nice dual wielding, counters after block etc.
It's basiclly time tested formula with new additions that keep the system fresh despite it's age.

Conclusion:
The game is great it delivers what was promised. An open world with countless paths that we can explore at our own leisure.An excellent gameplay with countless exciting ( and sometimes infuriatingly difficult [Malenia - poor controler had some close encounters with table]) boss encounters. It is without a doubt a must play for all fans of souls genre 10/10 and a solid contender for 2022 Game of the Year.",1,2

"Mar 18, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,You can do what ever you want in in this game and the best thing is exploring the side missions  are hidden and when you find you feel rewarded the story is a bit hidden like the other souls games but I can’t complain about it because it is a preference,1,2
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"I am literally unable to play the game. That's it guys really I can't play the game that I bought already months ago and that's not because it's hard or smth it's because Elden Ring crashed everytime when i try to launch. People complain about performance, graphics etc. and here i'm facing white screen crash whenever I open it. It has been two days since it's launch and there is no proper answer came out from developers. There are many people like me getting the same crash problem and it's still persist I mean what kind of game developer you are when your game doesn't run at all. Forget Cyberpunk 2077's or any game launch you have ever witnessed, I have never been in this situation before I can't play the game that has been already released. Elden Ring managed to being the worst launched game that I couldn't have imagined. I have tried every solution on the internet, updated every driver, reinstalled the game and even the most absurd ones like it's crashing because of the epic games launcher I tried everything and my situation remains the same this is the first moment in my gaming history that I couldn't find a solution to run a game properly with a decent PC.

No, I’m talking about the total lack of PC optimisation. PC gamers are pretty much forced to use a controller, as the devs have decided to provide very minimal mouse &amp; keyboard support. This isn't 1985, I'm not trying to play NES. Why do the devs force PC users, who're perfectly happy with mouse and keyboard (far higher skill ceiling &amp; superior fidelity), to use a controller? From Software just don't get it, it’s 2022, every other new AAA release has pretty much the same PC controls and user interface, which have been standardized over decades. Why does Elden Ring look like something from the 2000’s? The devs are lazy, and/or incompetent, couldn't care less about the PC market. Lots of Souls fanbois and paid “reviewers” making weak excuses for this garbage. I dare these shills to make a direct comparison between Elden Ring and God Of War or HZN, there’s just no comparison, it’s absolute garbage, Elden Ring falls well short of basic expectations.",8,17

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"It's remarkable how much From improves upon their foundations with every new Souls/Kiro/Borne/Ring game release. Even Demon's Souls found it's true potential once unshackled from the limitations of old tech. Elden Ring is no different, as we all expected (and dared to hope, after the fateful release of Cyberpunk). What's felt like a disappointing few years for video games, with companies focusing more on squeezing every dime out of their game systems instead of focusing on content, From Software's Elden Ring is the complete opposite.

- The World:  An impossibly scaled, Breath of the Wild-esque realm with secrets, story, and rewards in every corner. The game itself practically begs the player to explore every inch of it's hand-crafted world, which anyone who obliges will find themselves doing for hundreds of hours.

- The Weapons: As always, From is taking all the best parts of their old games, mixing it all together, and adding new ingredients into the mix on top! With the return of power stancing from Dark Souls 2 and weapon arts from Dark Souls 3 (which can now be mixed and matched between weapons, instead of being bound to a single one) and heavy charging from Bloodborne, we now have all the previous tools at our disposal to go forward with. Not only that, but with the addition of jumping attacks and guard counters, there is never a time where you'll find yourself lacking an option to attack. For anyone who is new to the series, or has indulged in past Souls PVP, you should know that one of the main ways a game keeps it's audience for such is *options*, and now we have plenty.

- The Online: Speaking of PVP, let's talk about the changes to how the online systems work from From's last game, Dark Souls 3. In 3, a host (the player upon which helpful and destructive players called 'phantoms' alike converge) was able to bring up to 6 people into their world, with the use of an item. Now, in Elden Ring, the maximum number of players that can ever be in a single world falls to 4. Additionally, destructive players (invaders) seeking to kill the host and reap the rewards will usually find the host flanked by a helpful player (a summon). This is due to From making it so the only players invaders can encounter are those with additional friendly players already in the world to help them. Many people who enjoy invading dislike this change for obvious reasons, as it makes their lives and their 'success' all the more difficult to obtain. I would remind these players, however, that invaders are *supposed* to be at a disadvantage, and are *usually* supposed to lose. While the occasional upset two-on-one victory is obtainable (and feels amazing), the invader is more geared to sap the host and summon's resources, making whatever boss they aim to face even more difficult than it would already be.

- The System Requirements: Call it a tough pill to swallow, but I believe that From made the right choice boosting the system requirements for their new game, and would support them doing the same in future game releases. The same way old cutting edge, mind blowing graphics quickly become obsolete, the same can unfortunately be said for the tech that runs it as well. If we want games to continually get more and more outstanding and vast, more detailed and intricate, then that will come with sacrifices for the older systems which can't run it. Imagine how much longer this game would've taken to come out, or how much less time the team would've had to fill it with interesting characters, storylines, environments, enemies, etc if their time was eaten up by making sure the game managed to function on dated tech? You've gotta draw the line somewhere.

Elden Ring is a one-in-a-generation game, GOTY nominee/winner for sure, and might even be considered the game of the decade when 2030 rolls around.",6,13

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"While this game isn't perfect, don't be discouraged by the smear campaign that's being organized against it.

Yes, on PC, this game has technical issues. For some people it's really bad, for others not so much. For me personally, on a i7-7700k CPU, and GTX 1080 GPU, I am experiencing a mostly silky smooth 60 fps experience.

There is, however, the stuttering issue. On some rare locations of the game, this game will stutter. This means, that the game will slow down to 30-45 FPS for anywhere between 0,5 to 2 seconds, and then return back to a smooth experience. This does not happen all the time. There are about two areas of the game where this seems to happen. It also gets better over time. For example, the by far worst area of the game, it used to happen every 5-10 seconds, but now happens maybe once every half minute. This area is not very large. Think half the size of Valentine from RDR2.

HOWEVER...

The rest of this game.... I almost have no words. I have never been this impressed/awestruck/mesmerized by any game I've ever seen, anywhere. I have been gaming regularly since 1995. This is the most visually impressive game I've ever seen. This is the most content dense environment in a game I've ever seen. And this isn't recycled content, oh no. This is meaningful, mind blowing, how-in-the-world-did-they-come-up-with-this-idea type content. The first time I ran this game, I kept playing for 17 hours. I cannot wait to go back.

Without thr technical issues, I would rate this game 11/10",6,13
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,1,"First things first it's 2020 and i still have to use the Flawless Wide Screen to get ultrawide support which could lead to a ban because of anti-cheat won't allow any third-party fixes.
the second thing the stuttering is unbelievable it's supposed to be a game that need precise movement but when it stops for a second or two, you're dead.
third thing the performance are so bad in some area's that led to frame drops and it's not because of my specs i have 2070 super and tried to lower all the graphic setting but it's still the same.
the fourth thing keyboard layout why the hell they didn't implant that in the game before releasing it it's confusing as hell to see press Y every damn time.
lastly bugs the game has its fair share of bugs like enemy's can hit you while you're behind a wall, the AI of your summons sometimes act dumb, you can get stuck under some large enemy, the high which can you jump from isn't the same in the open world and the dungeon's, lastly good luck trying to hit an animal without the lock on mechanics.

the game isn't bad it's enjoyable when it's playable but not at this time wait for them to release bug and performance issue then go for it otherwise, you're stuck playing it in a **** state.",11,24

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"I understand people complaining about the difficulty curve. I was actually hesitant about purchasing Elden Ring because of the same thing. Last souls game I truly enjoyed was demon souls, since then I lost patience to really learn the mechanics. That said I found Elden Ring significantly easier, just dodge a lot and you're good. I am 70 hours in and still havent bothered with parrying, just dodge. I would actually compare this to Breath of the Wild, also a higher difficulty curve, but the fun of the game is the exploration and just going wherever you want, there is a sort of structure to follow, but like BotW you actually should do a lot of other things before hitting the main points. And because I chose to just explore, I didnt have to grind any mobs or cheese my way to level up, I just naturally was the level I should be.
On to story. The story is actually quite good, I wouldnt say A Song of Ice and Fire storytelling good, but it kept me interested. The way story telling is done is what I enjoyed. In a normal rpg I may skip past the dialogue of a random npc to save time. In Elden Ring, every random npc is the story progression. So you will get bits and pieces as you play, and without an intended order of receiving those pieces. I never felt lost or confused, and every new person, faction, and secret region I discovered taught me so much more about the world and its inhabitants in a meaningful way.
In conclusion, Elden Ring isnt a typical rpg, if you want the next Elder Scrolls this isnt it. However if you want a dark grimy world that has a surprising amount of beauty and are willing to put in some time to struggle in some areas but persevere then Elden Ring may be a good fit for you. Watch a youtube video or 2 before purchasing anything.",5,11

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"So i played all the souls game at the dawn of time (yes, the original dark souls 1 and 2—pre-release of SoTFS, dark souls 3, original demon souls, and slightly bit of bloodborne at my friend 's house since i don't have a ps4 and is a pc geek after i sold my ps3). I haven't play Sekiro yet,..not any sooner in the future. You could say, i am a ""huge souls-game enthusiastic—excluding the sekiro part, i am not huge fan of samurai, ninja themed"", and since then very few game that could satisfy me like these game did.Elden Ring, however, managed to do it, and đó live up to the hype.The Major point is, the game's a mixture of Skyrim and Witcher, which's not a bad thing to start off (those who said, it's not creativity in 2022, it's not original in 2022,...blablabla is literally braindead and ignorant of how they see things. Like, every literature-part that was put in the gaming industry—excluding gears ofc, is a copy cat of each others from the start, so shut the **** up). However, it's more likely skyrim than witcher, the amount of freedom you get from Elden Ring is incredible, you can literally do anything—well not exactly anything, but roam freely to anywhere on the map, randomly encounter everything in the game, while keeping the challenge-core part intact, like many of its predecessors.Yes, these hardcore challenge + open world mechanism had made the game unplayable by some people—and the game is 100% quest free no pin point or glue to find but using senses, you can keep your opinion on it. But judging the game by not having stories, not having,.... and is boyscotting a certain game, is literal braindead.About the game's main problem, stuttering and fps dropdown, i just don't think it's a problem since i am playing it on an x o s series then compare it to my pc, consoles ported games sometime have problems and it's fine to have it if it was minor, not some critical damage to the device which run it lol, probably all the huge scores came from consoles (critics).",5,11

Pros:
- Graphics. So what if it looks outdated? I'd rather have a game that looks crisp like Witcher 3 and Gothic 3 (2 amazing RPGs even for today's standards) than some blurry, glowy, photorealistic crap like AC Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077. And whoever says it looks just like DS3 is not looking carefully enough.
- Accessibility. Finally we get a map, fast travel from almost anywhere, switchable control schemes, less vague dialogues, quest location aids, dungeon location aids, as many summoning helps as you want as long as you have enough FP, no more health regeneration after enemy retreat, an additional block counter move, far more doable than the parry, item crafting on the go, easy resource farming. Horseback riding AND fighting. Jumping. These are all things that previous From Software games simply did not have. Makes the game so much easier.
- Exploration. You can go anywhere and see where you're going, no more fog of war, and reaching places can be done from so many angles. It's impossible to get lost.
- Mystery. This game uses your brain, not just your reflexes. It gives you something to do, something to wonder about. Your curiosity is at its peak everywhere you turn. What if that cliff is hiding treasure at the base? Why are there so many monsters over there, are they protecting something valuable? IS THAT CASTLE MOVING?
- Fairness. It doesn't pit you against an impossible boss without the possibility to level up somewhere else instead of backtracking to farm the same monsters over and over.

Cons:
- FPS drops (I learned it's a general problem, not just my system's fault, which means it's patchable. Also, I don't get any FPS drops in dungeons, just outside where you can run away from danger anyway. Those drops are reduced if you reduce the Grass quality, but for now it's a con).
- Early stages. You need essential items for levelling up, crafting, item upgrading early on in the game if you're gonna make your life easier. But sometimes it's almost impossible to find them without an online guide. It can get frustrating when you get ashes of war, bolstering items, game hints, but you can't piece them together unless you spend a long time figuring it out. In the end we also want to have fun, not go to Dark Souls college.
- Soundtrack. Major downer for me. It takes away from the atmosphere. You had time, this could've been a masterpiece, making exploration so much more enjoyable. I'm really sorry about this one.

In the end I hope this review is helpful. I can say that it's a highly addictive game and I can't stop playing it even when I should. Please help :))",4,9

One of the best games I've ever played and suprising world with lots of stuff to discover. Just don't expect to be held by your hand and be led to all the things to find. Gameplay is very similar to other Fromsoft games but feels a lot more fluid and less clunky this time. Some of the optional bosses are not that memorable but the main ones are. And that is OK in my opinion as it's optional.

The only thing keeping me from giving it a 10/10 is the microstutter on PC.. But it's honestly not as bad as people make it out to be.

Map is big but empty, literal copy and pasted across entire regions.The gap in skill needed to play melee over magic is horrendous. Balancing is non existent.Don't even bother with co-op, it's the biggest ballache and half assed multiplayer experience I've ever seen. Not that it matters anyway, because doing anything outside of a dungeon will mean you'll get invaded every 10 minutes for ""balance"" reasons.

It's the worst case of Stockholm syndrome, it's like trying to talk to someone from North Korea. There's no point.The game isn't hard because of well designed bosses, enemies and movesets. It's hard because they kept tedious design decisions from older souls games, gave the bosses undodgeable attacks, the worst roll mechanic out of all the souls games, and allow the bosses to break game physics just to get the upper hand so you are constantly caught in a ""gotcha"" moment. Its not hard because it's a fun challenge, it's artificially hard. FS has let the hype go to their head and has made this game harder just for the sake of being harder, trying to buy into their difficult game reputation.It's just a dark souls rehash but made worse.

In addition to the performance and control issues that most PC gamers are writing about, the game has no ultrawide 21:9 or 32:9 support at all. Historically, this hasn't been an issue since the modding community fixes it within MINUTES after release. With Elden Ring, however, FromSoftware has decided to include Easy Anti-Cheat while ALSO going to extra effort to hide large portions of ultrawide users screens without their consent. This means we have to choose between playing online with most of our displays disabled, or playing offline with the usual community fixes. Either way, we're missing a huge part of the game, and for $60+ that is NOT okay. This is a terrible, half-baked PC port missing fundamental PC features and optimizations.

Game controls were mapped to an Xbox controller. Had to Google reddit forums on how to switch to PC.

Has amazing open world design. Probably best designed open world I have ever played, The map is huge and never feels dull to explore. The combat is solid and when you get used to it is really fun, The music is so good and I cannot wait to buy it when it is out. The difficulty is balanced and doesn't feel unfair. Kind of like previous FromSoft games. The bosses are probably the best here than they have been in any other Souls game. The attention to detail in this world is superb.

Bad-
The performance issues. Sometimes this game feels borderline unplayable. The stuttering and frame drops in a game where you need to be perfect is bad. The minor dungeons feel the same and not varied. The game needs an activity tracker. Some way to tell what quests I am doing because you start to feel lost and confused while playing and end up missing questlines.

Thoughts-
Elden Ring can be best described as the accumulation of everything that FromSoftware has learned in the last decade or so. Barring a few issues, it is an exceptional achievement in open world design. Very few games create that curiosity within players to explore their worlds so successfully, and Elden Ring is one of those games. I don’t know what the future holds for FromSoftware and whether they will continue to make open world Souls-like games, but if they can literally pioneer a whole new genre, then they may very well elevate the open world genre, which has been afflicted so commonly by bloat and blandness, as well.",7,17

Elden Ring es la evolucion de From Software hacia la grandeza, despues de este no se que puedo
esperar.
Es juego que cumple totalmente con las expectativas e inculso las sobrepasa.
Utiliza muy bien el mundo abierto a su favor ya que todo es explorable y genera curiosidad y misterio con su misticismo.
Las mecanicas son la evolucion de sus antecesores con lo cual tenemos una jugabilidad de alta calidad.
El caballo es una gran incorporacion ya que puede darnos combates cabalgando sobre Torrentera, incluso muchos enemigos se facilitan si combatimos montados sobre este.
Otra cosa genial, es como podemos moldear nuestro personaje a gusto, con una gran variedad de armas, hechizos e invocaciones. Si hay algo por lo que siempre se destacaron son las opciones en las que podes enfrentarnos a los Jefes.
Los enemigos son duros y este juegos es un reto, pero con voluntad, paciencia y centrandote en la exploracion para luego avanzar en la trama podras evolucionar a tu personaje para hacer el juego mas accecible y disfrutable.
Hay una gran cantidad de enemigos por todo el mapa y eso extraordinario.
Es verdad, la potencia o calidad grafica no es algo nunca antes vista ni altisima pero si hay algo que siempre nos va a garantizar FromSoftware es que su apartado artisitco es increible y este si que deslumbra. Estamos ante uno de los grandes de la industria ser sin luz.",7,17

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"If you release a game on PC, it should preferably actually be playable on PC. Not only are the graphics broken as far as performance goes, but most unforgivable to me, is the lack of controller support from a game that claims to have full controller support. None of my controllers work at all with this game, and this is just not the kind of game that works well with a keyboard and mouse. Completely unplayable on PC at the moment, perhaps if fixes come in the next few weeks I will give it another chance. If it takes longer than that I'll have moved on already. We PC gamers are pretty tired of getting shafted by game creators that release games in an unplayable state recently, I think. At this point you will just lose my support and attention entirely but pulling this crap.",8,20
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"I honestly don't care about the lack of ultrawide support, locked FPS, and I didn't make it far enough into the game to experience the stutter everyone is talking about, which I am confident I could ignore for the most part. In fact, I only made it as far as the main menu screen - several times in fact. Why? Because the devs couldn't do a basic thing that most others have figured out decades ago: controller support for PC games.

Seriously, what is this disgrace? Not only did my PS4 controller not work on steam by itself  (tried big picture mode and enabled the configuration in settings as well, still no response in game), but even after I installed DS4Windows and got it to work, there were only XBOX prompts provided... This game is available on PS4 as well you muppets! Just include the configuration from there! In fact, you could even just use different icons, replacing the XBOX ones if you felt lazy, but noooo, you were super lazy! Well, guess what, I am not going through a 60-100 hour game trying to memorise what button fits the prompt shown to me.  I got a refund, and you lost a customer and get a negative review now. Guess I'm watching a let's play now, since from what I've seen, the game is actually good. Too bad you couldn't even do the bare minimum for me... But you got all the 10/10s from the incompetent game ""journalists"", so everything is good for your shareholders...

Next time, try harder!",8,20

There's a new coat of paint, the world has expanded, the names have changed...but everything is essentially the same.  The combat is the same.  The animations are the same.  There are bonfires.  There's souls.  The biggest change is, they switched the jump button to A and the 'use' button to Y.

I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still a good game but if you were hoping for a fresh, revolutionary experience, this is really, really not it.",6,15
"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"Another overhyped triple A release that fanboys will inevitably defend no matter how many obvious flaws that are staring them in the face so disregard any 9 or 10 reviews.

Its pretty obvious at this point that this game is not even close to the ""masterpiece"" that ""critics"" and fanboys are claiming it is. I swear the term ""masterpiece"" gets tossed around so casually these days that its become irrelevant along with mainstream video game journalism. I truly cannot comprehend how you can look past all the performance issues/reused assets and then call this a good game.

The open world is easily the most glaring flaw because its so empty and generic. Unlike games like BOTW or Witcher 3 there aren't many ways you can interact with the environment outside of picking up useless crafting materials. The optional dungeons are essentially chalice dungeons from bloodborne except with more copy and paste boss designs and rewards that make going through them seem like a waste of time(spoiler, they are).

For all the fuss about GRR martin being the writer there is very little payoff. I was hoping he would give a more solid narrative other than the usual endless stream of item descriptions that are beyond overplayed at this point but I guess I expected too much from what everyone is calling a ""masterpiece"".

The combat is(you guessed it) more of the same. The only difference is that there is a jump button which has very little impact on what you do when fighting, you'll still be dodging, hitting, and then chugging estus in between. Anyone claiming this is good combat needs to be reminded how many souls games there have been and how it isn't impressive anymore. As a veteran I expected much more from the combat but hey, masterpiece amiright?

The NPC's are just as generic as the world they inhabit. The moment I encountered a talking jar was the point where I knew all semblance of immersion had been tossed out the window. No longer is there any coherence between what they are doing vs what you're doing in the world, now its just wacky nonsense.

As a souls veteran I'm pretty disgusted with the praise elden ring has received. It does nothing better than the original dark souls or demons souls so putting it on a pedestal just shows how easily reviews can be bought and fool casuals. I use this game as a litmus test to see how easily fooled someone is by video game hype, disregard any positive opinion on this game as market brainwashing, because that's all it usually is.",6,15
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"Overrated game
Elden Ring is a worst copy of Dark Souls. Worst optimisation, worst graphic, broken game-design.
Totally faked",6,15
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,4,"Once again the so called ""critics"" showed how unqualified they are when it comes to understanding what makes a game a good game and amazing gameplay. It is not the brand making a games with past achievements, it is the gamers themselves, no one else. Majority of these critics don't even spent the bucks for those games which cant' generate a bias opinions.

Now here is my opinion: this game is boring after few hours. Different model of a boss with different combos of the more or less same attacks you've seen before. Stuck in an empty open world which wasn't made to be amazed and looked at, just to traverse in and walking forward is not a good gameplay. Game is not optimized, tested on PC systems properly and I had issues on PS5 as well.
I don't care they can patch games, this game is expensive and I expect working title when it's released. So where did the money went before the release? Marketing it seems and to all those fake critics hyping it and making us disappointed before it is ready to be played by those who these games are made for. Gamers..

In the end, make a roll and attack, make a roll and attack, make a roll and attack, use special attack, call for help of few ghosts taking agro, stab them in the back, make a roll and attack.

Well that gets old very quickly. I don't care if you are hard on souls fan or not. I like game when it makes me feel like I am playing and getting my ass beat as much as I am beating the game's ass and here the only thing that beat my ass was poor design, and low optimization of the Elder Ring world.",6,15
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,3,"I have played the PC version for several hours (roughly 12-15).

If you have liked Souls games before Elden Ring and it is really your cup of tea, I guess you might like this still, if you are ready to overlook the many shortcomings it has. But if you haven't like any Souls games before this one, then just keep walking because this isn't for you either, definitely.

These are the facts on PC so far:
- Right off the bat, no Ultra-wide support.
- No 120 hz support in 4k (I don't know for other resolutions, I haven't tested).
- Barely hitting 60 FPS sometimes, if I'm lucky!
- The difficulty once again is ridiculously hard - unless you don't many responsibilities in life I guess maybe you'd have the time to put to maybe want to finish this pointlessly hard game?
- And last but not least, that no one really talks about: the story is awful and doesn't make any sense at all. I know, I know - the Souls games have never been known much for story in the past but FromSoftware should really have learn from their many mistakes at this point.

I mean a lot of us have been playing FS games since The Lost Kingdoms days. And it feels like somewhat we're almost back to this. The art style chosen is ok but it's not stellar and graphics overall sure even feels updated in many places for the times we currently live in.

All in all, this is definitely not the game I was hoping for. It's a bit better on console - mainly PS5 - but still suffers from mostly the same issues across the board.

I will keep walking for that one.",6,15

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,"This game is neither a magnum opus nor a pile of turd.
tldr great game terminal case of consoleitus portus.

I would give it a 9 if it weren't for the God awful, Horrific, Actual Crime that is the PC port. Playstation buttons instead of actual controls, i could only figure it out by trial and error since i already knew the DS control scheme. They decided to move the CRUCIAL keys to weird combinations (cough 2 handing) then release the worst PC port i have ever seen
I fortunately did not encounter any issues playing on a GPU that's BELOW the requirements, which confused me more than anything.

Mechanically the game is DS III™ but more, neither copying or transcending it's predecessor much. The major change is the open world which makes it far easier to level up for a boss if he is legitimately too difficult, something that DS™ never dealt with well.
I would say, whoever, the people who complain and give it a 0 because they think they have to grind for 20 hours can go Git Gud™, since this is a Souls™ game, and struggle against superior foes is a part of it to attain a sense of achievement. You do not need to 1 shot a boss to kill him.
I do admit the game has it's flaws, like the movement/camera feeling dated by now, and torrent being a motorized pile of turds, but they do not overshadow the Souls™ experience here.

The plot in Souls™ games never really was more than a vague purpose with a lot of disconnected lore, and while the whole ""GRRM Made this"" was a marketing stunt, the world isn't lacking in detail. It's there for you to draw your own conclusions, like any souls game, but without esoteric item descriptions that don't match their items. It's perfectly serviceable

Graphically it's also serviceable since the focus is on gameplay, though i had to admit it looks dated and even DARK SOULS II™ gives it competition. The style however, saves it, looking distinctly more alive and hopeful than the other Souls™ games, which were decay at it's best.

I would say ELDEN RING™ made by FromSoftware™ is a Great™ Experience™ if you are already deep into DARK SOULS™. For newcomes, the open world makes it easier to do other things than in DARK SOULS™ where you will face brick wall bosses where you pretend you're a crash test dummy.",2,5

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,3,"I am desperately looking for that masterpiece so many critics claimed to see in this game.

From a technical point of view, its a desaster.
Bad controls, laggy input, enemies stun locking you, microstutters all along.
Menu handling is atrocious, quick slot management is a bad joke.

There are so many items, that are hardly explained at all - You are up to trial and error and guesswork to figure out how things work.

Enemy difficulty is all over the top and while I know, thats part of a souls game, the enemies here are unfair.
You either play perfectly or you die. Period. Nothing much inbetween. You cant run, cause you run to slow.  When you are trying to mount you are likely to be hit during that. If you ever get smashed to the ground, you can reload already, you are not getting up again alive. Hits are often nor registering and you are driven by a constant momentum, that easily moves you out of an enemies hitbox, while the visuals show your swort going through the enemy just fine.
As the controls are so bad, playing perfect is pretty impossible to pull off, so the only thing remaining is frustration.

Visuals are nice, but nothing out of the ordinary.

Story... Well, what story? I have been playing for nearly 10 hours now and the only piece of story is ""You are a chosen, grab the ring, save the world"" presented in like 2 minutes? The story is pretty much on par with super mario from the NES times so far.

I have been runnning around, killing &amp; dying a lot and looking for an actual sense in what i am doing.

Exploring feels interesting, but usually only rewards you with death. I have yet to find any usefull gear, well actually any gear I can use at all. Drops are scarce and so far not matching my class or just worse than what I had from the beginning on.

Overall, my gameplay experience is ""Kill and be killed, rinse and repeat"" -  because thats all there is to this game. Unfortunately i went way beyond the refund time to look for more in this so-called masterpiece, but as far as I can tell, there just isnt more to it.

Summary : A soulless shell with lots of grinding and frustrating controls, sporting tons of technical issues and a tedious interface.

Não consigo entender como que um jogo que eu nem consegui jogar ganhou uma nota tão alta, o jogo tá todo zoado, interface horrorosa, contra intuitiva, meu monitor é 75hz e o jogo simplesmente me obriga a jogar em 60hz, que zoa todas as cores e deixa o brilho lá no alto. Os caras tem preguiça até de implementar um sistema que reconhece automaticamente se tu tá usando um controle ou um teclado, entrei no jogo com a interface com botão do Xbox, isso não seria um problema se eu CONSEGUISSE USAR o controle, que se recusa a funcionar, e sempre que eu conecto, além do controle não funcionar, ainda buga o teclado, eu fiquei DUAS HORAS tentando fazer essa porcaria funcionar pra mim conseguir jogar. Além disso o jogo roda mal demais, trava, da stutter e eu ainda tenho que aguentar a ""mídia especializada"" falar super bem dos gráficos dessa carroça, que se tu botar lado a lado com Dark Souls 3 de 2016 tu não nota a diferença, rodei essa miséria com os gráficos no máximo e achei feioso demais.

A história do jogo também não é nada demais comparada com o que já tinha nos jogos anteriores, o combate é melhorzinho mas nada que te deixe de boca aberta.

Let me tell you this is no God of War. Booted this game up thought it looked okay, kind of like an old 360 game, but whatever. Must be a good story or something.

Speaking of story I guess other than the one eyed girl and the crappy cutscene there isn't really one. Figured since it had the Game of Thrones writer on it it may be cool, but I guess this is the reason why everyone hates the damned show now. He must not be very good, probably another SJW propped up by the hollywood elites.

Dodge mechanics are pretty clunky and don't seem to work quite right.. Seems like your character's hit box is larger than Nancy Pelosi's slush fund. Clipping seems to guarantee that the enemies kill you through walls and rocks and other crap, but you never seem to go through them. I presume it's some intentional feature to create a faux sense of challenge to the game. The alternative is that the programmers lack the technical wherewithal to pull of what they're striving for. Now that I think on that though it's probably the latter with the number of bugs this game has. Frame rate drops are pretty harsh and consistently occur on boss encounters.

Maybe it would have been a cool game if the story was any interesting or if the developers were worth a lick, but they seem to be reaching for the stars when they can't even grab the dirt off the floor very well. Play God of War any of them and hard if you wanna play a real good game.

So, I had Stutter, stutter, stuttering so bad it was unplayable. Bugs everywhere, and bad hit boxes made this game a BIG no for me.
I am back on bloodborne, I think I'm almost finished it, and then I will play Sekiro.

Fromsoft released a broken game and the meta critic scores, why the hell didn't they tell us about how badly the game runs, don't show this. What a shame such a small (39) group of obvious souls fans reviewed it and decided to not disclose just how bad it runs. Even if they love a series they shouldn't give it a pass. Do your job next time!

Other games in the past have been ripped apart because of releasing with these same issues. Yet this is GoTY? Can I also point out that in this day and age you'd think even a Souls game would up its graphics and physics system to the industry standard for AA and AAA games. Walk through foliage and nothing responds which breaks immersion. The graphics/assets/textures look like it came from 2013. I'm not joking. The style of the game is more of the same.
The game does nothing new, even copying Breath Of The Wilds open world format to a T.

If you are a pro critic I ask that in the future you stay consistent with your reviews. This way people can get a proper read on what a game is without your obvious childish bias masking a broken game just so it sells well or whatever your reasoning was.

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,4,"Bad performance on PC right now and mouse and keyboard and mouse controls are not ideal. As for gameplay and graphics it is nothing special either. A rehash of previous games, particularly in boss fights, without much that is new, especially in regards to models and animations. I do hope this lazy formula is on the way out for future from software games. Ironically it seems the remaster of From software's first Souls game, Demon's Souls is the companies benchmark to beat. I would like to see something more along the lines of the first half of Dark Souls 1 with 80+ hours of slow burn and perfect gameplay, perfect graphics, refined level design and a heroic journey. No warping, big lead up to bosses and high stakes. Fromsoftware keeps nearly making a great game but is every time an unfulfilled promise. Dark Souls was almost this but the second half was obviously rushed. Demons Souls, Dark Souls I and II are still the best games they have made and FromSoftware is still to top them. They must take the best successes of all their previous releases and make something great. To me, Elden Ring is not this. The horse platforming is a kind of fun mini game but overall the open world is tedious and doesn't feel like you are really exploring anything. When the game goes back to the original dark souls style in Stormfront castle the game feels much better and after seeing what it had to offer, to me the open world aspect with a huge influence from Breath of the Wild, of the game is a big waste of resources when they could have been designing a much more dense linear environment. Fighting is overwhelmingly tedious compared to previous games and rushing past enemies to the bosses or checkpoints is the best strategy which seems like a flaw in the design. Killing enemies does not reward enough souls to make it worthwhile. Boss fights no longer have a strategy you can learn over time so you can eventually outsmart them and fights become a war of attrition and based on luck as opposed to feeling like you are actually fighting the enemy in a meaningful way as for example they were in Sekiro. Elden Ring overall feels like it is spread too thin trying to have too much content.",6,17

It's funny how this game gets treated to godly standards for doing the bare minimum, just because its FromSoftware. Had this game been by Ubisoft or Activision, the narrative would be so different. Journalists and gamers would slander the game for years to come if that were the case.

Oh and Pc controls are a massive pain in the butt!... having to hit G for the map key because it wont bind to another key just highlight some of the ridiculous and lazy issues that really shouldn't exist with these AAA games!..supposedly made for multiple platforms!  Reminds me of the usual PC port goofiness that the other Souls games all suffered with, so I kinda expected some issues, but not as bad as this.  This game like so many these days has been designed for consoles..with a slightly raised two fingered gesture to PC owners!
So not off to a good start with the lack of keyboard configuration options.
On a positive note, it runs and looks cool-ish in 4k ON A 48in LG OLED 120htz screen, though it needs an i9-10900k, 64gb ram and RTX 3090 to achieve that! Though weirdly its still got a 60fps cap in the PC version, just like the consoles! That's just lazy...The fact there is mod out after a day to bypass this, asks the question, why couldn't the developers have offered that option too?
Ive only put just a few hrs into the game so far...But one thing ive noticed and its already really, REALLY starting to irritate me! Its just too damn hard!!!..its a painful and irritating grind!!!  I like a bit of a challenge, am used to setting any difficulty level at the start to accommodate my ability and style of play, but this game has no difficulty settings, just its one level = NIGHTMARE!  Its starting to take the fun out of an otherwise amazing experience.
Its also a bit repetitive and boring... enemies scattered about as if its a chess game, just placed willy nilly by whoever programmed it!, wolves spawning from the sky in front of you! wow its just ridiculous! and other weird creatures all just waiting till you get within their attack radius...So forget stealth, its almost non existent, so creeping about is a pointless exercise and option.  Their is no real AI, just animals and enemies scattered about the landscape with their own specified attack radius, step inside that radius, they come at you, step outside it again by running away, they stop. I think Skyrims AI is better! And that game is 11 years old!
I initially and overexcitedly gave this game a 9!...but am afraid the lack of PC controls with irritating binding issues, coupled with the game destroying insane fixed difficulty level!....its more than a challenge..its a painful and self torturing experience to even want to push on after dying so many times...No save options, just respawn back at your last 'grace' location which could be 30-40 mins of gameplay behind you! wasted!....Like i said before, the difficulty just feels like its set to nightmare, especially after a few hours in, the fact it cant be changed is a complete game breaker for me! Its just making me want to stop playing it.
Such a shame the gameplay is repetitive and grinding, because the artistic creativity and amazing buildings/creatures in Elden Ring is a work of pure art!  This game could of been great...lets leave it at that.",12,36

A lot of re-used animations from 2014. FPS capped at 60, the graphics, optimisation/framerate, stability and PC controls are not even on par with other PC 3rd person action titles like Monster Hunter World which came out in 2016.

Overall the game is okay if you can overlook that, probably more like a 4 out of 10 but when publishers/developers stop with these intentionally malicious releases then we'll stop with the reviews that are slanted this way.

Locked framerate.

Don't even bother looking at those so called ""critics"" reviews. They are either getting paid by game publishers to write great reviews or are delusional just like fanboys, who will defend game no matter in what state that game is.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"Zero to help balance the obvious paid/NDA reviews. Game itself is a solid 7-8.

On the game itself.. This is easily the best damn Souls-like game I've ever played and I'm having a blast. Being open world fixes the vast majority of my gripes about previous Souls games. Dark Souls should have gone open world long ago and this game proves it. Having space to dodge and roll around your OP enemy is like the first time you've tasted your favorite food. It makes you realize ""I'm the problem, I just need to figure this out"" vs ""this is impossible."" I absolutely adore the DS method in an open world environment. Mad, MAD props to FromSoft for going open world. This is likely where the reviewers stopped and posted OMG100/100 GREATESTGAMEOFALLTIME!!1!11!

Cons that warrant my rating?

Most overrated game of all time? Easily. I'll skip over the massive performance issues for now as they're well documented.

As a game DS was very niche to begin with. It followed a steep learning curve of ""figure out your enemy's move set and work around it to win"" formula. In this Elden Ring has shined. The problem is enemies have ZERO ai and it shows in an open world vs standing in a hallway. Stand on a rock and they're completely broken. I was able to defeat several bosses and many mini bosses by abusing the terrain while completely ignoring their move set. Not to mention if you range hit a mob his buddy will completely ignore you while you gank your target. WORST AI IN HISTORY. (Sidenote: Throwing knives and arrows move like they're going through Jello but ignore gravity. Even f*cking Minecraft takes gravity seriously.)

The menus, oh god the menus. They're about as intuitive as building a piece of IKEA furniture with no instructions and 4 screws missing. Every spell, weapon, or item you equip has almost no description, is clunky to equip, and has no stats outside of weapons. In a game where stats are crucial this is a massive failure. This was solved 30 years ago in games and only makes FromSoft look incompetent. There's no popup tooltips when you hover over stats and you have to resort to looking up stuff online to make any sense. I don't mind trial and error when fighting mobs. It shouldn't be in the menus too.

Fans will claim ""realism"" to defend it. **** I'm killing waterlogged zombies stretched out like a rubber chicken with their flesh literally falling off their bones that magically can overpower me if I get too close. Don't talk to me about realism.

Good luck figuring out how to change native control popups from Xbox to KB/Mouse. It's under SOUND controls because that makes total sense. (Settings&gt;sound&gt;onscreen prompt device if you need to fix this) I mean, what's the chance a PC user would want to use a keyboard and mouse instead of an xbox controller? That's unheard of. /s This was solved a decade ago on PC but FS wasn't at that meeting.

Targeting. Why is there no target tabbing? If there's a little bastard in my face but a hulking monstrosity trying to annihilate me standing over him guess what gets targeted? I have to move my mouse a full screen swipe towards the big guy to get the target to change before I can dodge meaning I'm already dead. Ironic when you need to turn the mouse sensitivity to it's absolute minimum to make it even usable.

My last con&gt; PERFORMANCE. We all know how **** this game runs, and it's well documented. It can't maintain 30fps on PS4, can't maintain 60fps on PS5, stutters wildly on a fire breathing PC, but looks like an early PS4 game? When I see suggestions that it's best played as a PS4 disc (lowest quality) on a PS5 that's a problem. There's no way in hell this is a 100/100 game and this proves reviewers were either paid or under a hard NDA to not mention performance prerelease.

When I'm playing on a PC that runs Cyberpunk 2077 at 60fps in 4k but this runs at less than 60 with constant dips into the low 20s while looking like a game from 2016 that's a big issue. I honestly can't name another title that runs this badly. Maybe RDR2 but that looks vastly better than this.

As a Dark Souls game this is easily 12/10 and everything I could hope for. When you take all other games into account? Solid 7, maybe 8 and that's being generous. There's too many problems here other studios solved decades ago. All my problems have also been all over reddit so I'm not alone. Any reviewer that calls this a 100/100 game meaning perfect should never be trusted again.

TLDR: I absolutely LOVE this game, but it's far from perfect and DS fanbois need to be honest with themselves. Hard does not equal good. Now you're playing with the big boys and this is mediocre at best.",5,15

-In 2022, u can't develop a game without ULTRAWIDE support. Ok, u never did ultrawide support but before we had mod making your game better. Now u put easy anti cheat so every mod we put in make us banned from the game, also ultrawide mod.

-In 2022, u provide us a game with a 2gen old graphic (it's something like PS3). Ok it doesn't matter but let it run flawless. No. It strutter like no tomorrow. I have a 3080 TI and the frame (already capped a 60fps) drops to 30 in every moment of the game, bossfight included.
-In 2022, u are lacking every good features existing in the world like DLSS, Ray Tracing, AMD FSR etc.
-Where is Steam cloud? we are still in the age where if you format the pc you lose all the saves?
-Why if i want close the game i have return to menu (watching everytime the from's logo and bandai's logo) and only after i can close the game. Maybe u could make closing the game just a little bit faster?

You didn't find time for make this game playable and enjoyable on PC and XBOX (Also there is exrtemely bad optimizated) but u found the time for develop haptic feedback on PS5 (the game on PS5 work properly, more or less).

"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"I think a lot of the dark souls fans are ruining a lot of games for saying they are ""to easy"". Final Fantasy orgins and Doom eternal is an example of this. Take a game that's not broke and ramp up difficulty to 1000x because some dark souls fan that says dark souls on the hardest difficulty is too easy wants to be catered to and void the true die hard fans of the series because it is a trend. what happened to games that are universally loved by everyone and not divided like Skyrim and it's difficulty? I want dark souls fans to have their own games though and leave other games alone so I think elden ring is fine for them just leave games that other fans like alone and stop pressuring devs to ramp the difficulty up to 1000x not everyone likes insane challenges and boss fights. Now before anyone says I want games easy is wrong too because I hate games that are just cinematics and map markers that hold your hand but I think we shouldn't also go to the extreme other side of that either with every game catering to only dark souls difficulty fanboyz. Some of us has jobs and things to do and don't like insane challenges. Understand this is also coming from someone that beat Elden ring so just saying I'm just not good at it is a lie (I just find being sweaty constantly whether on multiplayer games or single player games is just annoying). I beat the game because I had no other game to play but I personally didn't care for it. I don't like constantly feeling sweaty and annoyed by a game. I bought this game in the assumption that it was good since everyone was saying the game is so great but I was wrong. Sometimes I just want to relax and enjoy a game, but it seems now a days a game is either so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in one day or so hard that you need a fifth of vodka, Adderall and crack cocaine to just beat the first thing you see. It's always one extreme to the next never right where it should be. Dark souls fanz stay in your own lane and on your own games and stopping ruining new games and stepping on everyone's feet just so you can be catered to not everyone likes DS so get over yourself, grow up and stay on your own games or F***off. Right now these Youtubers and twitch streamers are defending you because they are just tired of easy games and same ol' formula but once they realize how biased the DS fans are you're going to be hated like every other toxic community that has died over the years.",1,3
"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,"After achieving a platinum in Steam I can easily say that this is overall a good game but sometimes it's just too frustrating.
I mean it's still definitely a dark souls game with all that positives and negatives which I personally like but with a GIANT open world. It is pretty obvious that this open world would be rather empty or full of reuses so FROM SOFTWARE chose the second option. I can't even tell you how many times I've killed that Erdtree avatar or Ulcerated Tree Spirit. For me this is too grindy. Someone might say that cleaning the open world isn't necessary and that would mean that this person hasn't played the game at all. The very first story boss clearly tells you to go and clear a few dungeons and catacombs before you come to him.
The next thing I don't really like is summons. You can literally just summon one thing on a boss and go have a cup of tea because this summon will just do everything by itself. Personally, I didn't use that thing and it took me a long time to master some of the bosses, but my friend just finished them in one try using this thing.
But like I said before, it's still a dark souls game that I love and I really enjoyed the game.",1,3

"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"A nigh perfect souls game set in a vibrant, dense open world. From Software have picked up the best parts of all the previous Souls games, Bloodborne and Sekiro and have added a lot more to make this game.
The combat and other gameplay elements are top notch and the sound design and music is a new high bar for the Soulsborne genre.
I've personally encountered no performance issues/crashes on my PC but I'm sure fromsoft will patch the issues out at the earliest.",1,3

"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"One of the best game I ever played. Imagine a mix between Witcher 3, Zelda BotW and the darkness of the Souls.This game is HUGE, I already played over 100 hours and I feel I know nothing about all the world and his secrets. I wasn't a fan of Souls but for me this game is a master piece ! The game is not as frustrating as Sekiro f.e, the open world allows you to move and do other quests and things till you feel confortable and come back.I just can recommand you to play it, you won't regret.",1,3
"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Elden ring is one of the best FromSoftware games. The good points to highlight are its graphic section along with gameplay and the wide variety of enemies and bosses throughout the map, but my only negative point is the drop in FPS on PC, although the studio is already working on a solution to that problem.",1,3
"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"This has to be my favorite Souls game so far. Open world exploration and progression matches very well with the soul stile and gives a good change of phase from dungeons.
Difficulty is similar to Dark souls 3 and Sekiro, but since you have more options, it seems I got stuck less on difficult encounters and bosses.
Main story and lore seem a little bit more straightforward that the previous games, however there is still a lot of hidden information for the community to discover. My only complain is that one of the endings feel very similar to the classic dark souls ending, I hoped from could do a more elaborated ending which is the case for the other endings, but I hoped for more.
Finally, on retrospective what it feels interesting to me is the sense of scale this game have, everything is big and expansive and bosses are huge to sold you on the danger and grandeur of the adventure I think this is the best from software has been able to archive this feeling.
As for PC performance I must report that after changing some setting I am 99% of the time at 60 fps on my laptop I have some occasional slowdowns on the overworld they are rare and minor. I am not sure if this if from the latest patches or from me changing the setting (changing from Fullscreen to borderless window seems to do the trick). On this case this seem to be the best running from software game for me as I did have slowdowns on Darksouls 3 and Sekiro. I hope From Software gets better technically on the future, but at least to me this seems their best work yet.
GAME OF THE YEAR!!",1,3
"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,From software really outdid themselves this time. This game takes all of the best pieces of their previous titles and makes them better.I was hesitant at first since I didn’t know how their formula would work in an open world but I was wrong and couldn’t be happier.,1,3
"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Fantastic game. The world is gorgeously and purposefully designed on another level to any other game I've played. The combat has ds3 DNA with some positive changes.

These things do bother me but all things considered it's still an incredible game",1,3
"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Elden Ring brought a new set of challenges which I was not expecting and that is something I can appreciate as a Souls fan. Performance issues aside, the world of ER is big and beautiful to explore. Lots of cool bosses which can be borderline impossible but leave a great sense of accomplishment. Wide variety of enemies and interesting areas spread throughout the game. For some of my less favorite aspects of the game, the crafting system is somewhat useless. I used it once to craft sleep arrows and that was for a very poorly designed boss which I won't mention here. The over-engineering of some bosses/mobs, which made strength builds nearly obsolete due to how little window there is to attack for the majority of bosses. Overall, this is the hardest game I ever played which is something I can appreciate. Starting NG+ and looking forward to playing this again.",1,3
"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"El juego está muy bueno, graficamente el avance para un juego de FromSoftware y de mundo abierto es genial, y corre perfectamente en una 1050 despues de actualizar sus driver una maravilla",1,3
"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"After almost 140 hours of play and in the middle of NG+, my verdict on the game.

There are a lot of positive things, but also negative things.

Dark Souls 4, oh I mean Elden Ring is one of the best games I've ever played. The game has a fantastic open world with a lot to discover. A very good story with multiple playable endings. The desire and motivation for a New Game + is definitely there.

As in all Souls games, dying is part of the program and if you have a problem with Demon's Souls, Dark Souls and Bloodborne, you probably won't like Elden Ring. The game is a bit more generous and beginner-friendly, offers more to level but not easier in the end.

Now we come to the bad things.

The performance of the game is catastrophic in certain places, FPS drops to ~5 and it's not my hardware, it's a problem that many have in the same places in the game. The game sometimes freezes for me or just closes instantly.

I bought the retail launch version in an online shop, it was supposed to come with a steelbook and the pre-order items. I wanted the steelbook and the goodies, the steelbook and the pre-order bonus are missing and now I can't even upgrade to a deluxe version or I can buy the full game again for 79.99... That's really bad service. Normally you can always upgrade the games to a better version. That makes me a little sad.

In the end it will still be one of the best, most important games of our time, setting new standards.",1,3
"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,"A great game with relatively minor issues that I personally have faced.

It's hard and unforgiving, but much more accessible than previous Souls like games from FromSoftware. Work needs to be done to perfect the port, but as of the 12/3/22 it's working perfectly fine on my PC. Those who complain about the 60FPS lock are screaming into thin air, it is clear the engine is reliant on that 60FPS lock, very similar to how Skyrim is.

Overall, it's great fun, but very difficult and can be very annoying to a new player. It's not perfect, and it's a way off the 10/10 score many people spout, but it's a game that has adequately lived up to it's enormous hype, which is very rarely seen.",1,3

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Big Dark Souls, fantastic game. Stuttering issues, minor boss glitches and inconsistent multiplayer sessions only thing holding it back.

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"More of what you've come to expect from a souls game, but with a horse.....",1,3
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"First of all, I don't have any stuttering issues on my average self build gaming PC and the loading times from my m2 are sweet. While I wish Elden Ring were produced mainly for the PC, thus having some shiny features like ultra wide support or slightly better graphics, it's not a deal breaker for me, because a good game is not just about shiny graphics (Paper's please, Return of the Obra Dinn, Rimworld) and I had hoped, my fellow gamers, would agree with me, but apparently Ubisoft's brain washing paid off.

I keep reading the word masterpiece and it's true. Elden ring as the amalgamation of everything From Software has learned from previous Souls games is the crowning achievement of Myazaki. The poetic story telling, the impressive visuals – the way the brightly glowing elder tree towers over a continent befallen by sickness and distress comes to mind – and finally the impressive arsenal of weapons and well thought out combat – it's nothing short of amazing. I wish From Software had these stuttering issues, a bad port and every other minor inconvenience people whine about in their reviews as if it were the end of the world in a different game and avoided this overshadowing their magnum opus, but  it is what it is. enjoyed my 50 hours so far and to all the people crying about accessibility, I can only say:""Git gud and ram your head against the wall until it breaks or leave, level up somewhere else and come back with your newly acquired floppy hammer for more kinetic energy to give them the business.""",1,3
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"OK. I created an account specially for this because I'm sick of stupid people who don't know FromSoft games and rage-quit after the Grafted Scion leaving 0/10 reviews. So let me address some of the points that they made.
1. “The pc port is horrible, and the stuttering is awful”
I personally am playing on a 2020 laptop not built for gaming, playing on high graphics, and the game has stuttered once very mildly at Stormhill. I'm writing it off, but if your pc isn't good enough to play it on ultra-high settings, perhaps consider lowering them rather than **** about it on the internet. Plus, IMO, it's no grounds for leaving a 0/10 review.
2. “The graphics are outdated”
The game is f**king stunning, guys. Plus, if you've ever played a FromSoft game, you'll know that graphics isn't the main priority. The lore, story, and gameplay are more important – leading me onto my next point:
3. “There's no lore!”
Yes there is you **** donkey. One piece of advice? Play the game.
4. “It's too hard”
I'm sorry, but there's an incredible technique – changed my life. You ready to hear it?
Ok, here goes…

Git gud

5. “It's just hype, people are lying and saying that it's good just because they're fanboys”
Nope. I'ts been out for 5 days, and it's already one of my most played games in steam. That's not hype, that's astounding gameplay that forces you to keep on coming back.

6. “It's not actually open world”/ “It's nothing new, open world isn't revolutionary”/ “It's so empty”
Yes, it is open world. The definition states:

“In video games, an open world is a game mechanic of using a virtual world that the player can explore and approach objectives freely, as opposed to a world with more linear and structured gameplay”

No, it may not be revolutionary, but it's incredible to see the mix of dark souls and open world. THAT'S what's revolutionary. And also, this is empty? I've never seen a less empty world – not Skyrim, not BOTW, not any game.

And finally, people comparing it to CyberPunk2077…
Did you guys even play it when it came out? It was full of bugs, and was virtually unplayable. Now THAT'S an example of overhype.

I find it funny people doing no research, spending 60 dollars on a game that was not meant for them, and then leaving a rating of 0 – decreasing the average to a measly 6.1/10 (at time of writing).

Do I think it's 10/10? Probably not. IMO it's 9/10, but I need to get these reviews up, so I added the extra point.

Great work Miyazaki! Keep it up.",1,3
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"This Is amazing even if die over and over again but this is a solid great game please play it as long as you dont mind the deaths the many deaths 9999999 out of 9999999 good game!

(oh and if complain about how hard the game is then get gud or dont get souls games)",1,3
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"I am appalled by people what people is complaining about. I've a slightly above the minimum pc and I'm playing basically without any worries. True, sometimes while running in the open the game stutters, or the frame drop to 25, but usually I'm between 45-55 fps and have never experienced this with a boss nor I died because of this. And yet some people compare this to CP77? Probably are running a potato or never bothered updating a driver.

And this is the medium level of the critic: ""I play on keyboard and mouse and it shows me controller input"". To be fair to me these are quite forgettable critics. I mean, come on, does people really get the difference between 60 and 144 fps?

Long story short: performance are fine. They'll likely be improved, because yes they can, but are fine and there is no such thing as a ""0, litterally unplayable"", if you don't have cognitive dissonance.

Then gameplay, history, lore, mechanics, aesthetic, everything is amazing and perfect.

Is also kind of hard (Dark Souls hard) and I suspect this to be the main problem of many negative reviews. Thank you Margit.
This along with missing the ""go there, do that"" point on the map, but again, as usually fromsoftware does. You can understand what to do (and usually is ""kill everyone"") and where to go the moment you think about it. I mean, a NPC told you ""go north"" you go north, even if in the map there is no sign, right? I'm speechless by how many times I read stuff like this.

This is likely to remain as a masterpiece in the years (and decade) to come. It is not a revolution, or a total innovation, but it's the peak of several genres.",1,3
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,Best open world game made up to this day. Awfully optimized yet FROM blames user's hardware for it.,1,3
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,6,"I have to say that this is a really good game overall, but it's a very bad soulslike game, and as a longtime fromsoft fan, I expected a soulslike rather than a traditional open world RPG, which is the reason for my low score.

THE BAD:
Fromsoft made the game more accessible, but that killed what made their previous games memorable. The adrenaline rush you felt after killing harder bosses/mini bosses and overcoming challenges was amazing. But in Elden ring I felt no such accomplishment at all, I didn't feel challenged at all. No boss or miniboss took me more than 5 tries, and i did not use summon nor sorcerer builds. Of course the game could've been challenging, if I level up less, upgrade my weapons less, don't use ashes of war but... if I have to actively avoid using the games mechanics to make the game challenging then that is just simply bad design. Previous fromsoft games had a natural progression to them, unless you went out of your way to farm you did not overlevel. Also there were quite a few bosses in ds3 that had high magic res and gave mages a tough time to balance things out, ER does not have such things.

There are some other minor issues as well, lot's of overused minibosses, repetitive catacombs, mounted combat is boring. Bosses are not fun, all the delayed attacks ruin the flow of the fights that ds3/sekiro/bloodborne had. Lot's of downtine between action, not so action packed as previous titles.

THE GOOD:
Visually amazing world, combat is improved, ashes of wars and spells are fun to use, boss mechanics and visuals are also really cool.

Overall: IMO they should've sticked to the non open world format, the open world hurt the game more than it added, but it could be fixed with some balancing/tuning. Multiply the healthbar of every enemy by 1.5-2x, I think that's easier to do than nerfing  everything.",1,3
"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"I have never reviewed a game in my life, had to create a metacritic account just to do so; this game is just fantastic. The souls series might not be for everyone but it's very sad to see people giving this amazing game a 0 because they are unable to put in the time and effort to learn the game's mechanics. Absolute masterpiece regardless. Oh, and PC performance issues were fixed very soon after launch.",1,3

"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"This is by far the best game I have played in a long while.  Sure, there are definite bugs in it that cause some creatures to not do what they are supposed to do, but if you ignore that and just concentrate on the game itself... ( and to all the people complaining about PC issues, Get a better PC, I had no issues with Lag or framerate.)  The Hitboxes are absolutely perfect..  If you know your weapons range, then you can predict and time all your hits. Combat is amazing with the addition of the Block Counter (Way to go Software!!) The open world is so massive and it really touches the heart.. the Difficulty is perfect.. not as hard as Dark souls 2, but not so difficult that you can't beat the game.   Now for the Cons..
The Summons are way to powerful they need to be nerfed..  a Single Summon can defeat a boss alone without your assistance.. this should not happen.
Certain Magic spells are overpowered and should be nerfed.
Quests should have more descriptive instructions.  Currently they are to vague.
Item locations should have more descriptive Colors; Weapons 1 color, armor another... bla bla..
The Map itself is hard to read and should be better descriptive on how to reach areas.
Every Trinket should have it's own questline.",1,3

"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Great game. Don't listen to most of the review bombs from new accounts with two reviews, the other being horizon. It's like people bought a souls game and are offended that it's a souls game. It's a classic souls game with a lot of the same mechanics from previous games. It's more accessible as there are usually sites of grace (bonefires) right outside the boss rooms.  You can also fast travel to any of them right from the start of the game. Being open world they have a lot of smaller side dungeons throughout that can be vested in 15 to 20 minutes but they also have those classic longer ones.   It's more accessible than previous games but the combat is in line with previous entries and in my opinion it's more difficult. There is story but like all souls game it's not something presented to you on a silver after. Everything has to be earned in souls games.  People who look at dying in a souls game like a failure might have a hard time with this as dying is part of figuring out enemy and boss attack patterns. I will say that the PC version has some performance issues that need to be patched so my actual review is 9 out of 10 but I gave it a ten to try and balance out all the review bombers who gave up after an hour.",1,3

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,"Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus ""Notch"" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens ""Jeb"" Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.

In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks and simple machines. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and access to flight. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

Early versions of the game received critical acclaim, winning several awards and being cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, and the mobile game Minecraft Earth.",8,25

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,2,"Why did I get trolled into thinking yet another Souls game wouldn't be complete and utter trash?  The open world aspect combined with GRRM supposedly writing the story suckered me in.  Oh how trolled I am yet again.  Story?  STORY?!  It's the same non-story all these crap games have.  What the hell was GRMM Needed for?  There is no story as per usual.  Open world?  No more or less than the other titles were.  You're still gear gated into linearity, except now you just have more ways to screw yourself beyond repair and have to just start a new save if you get stuck early in an area such as the the poisonous swamp from a ""treasure portal"".

I have a newsflash for all the fanboys of these crap games:  It is in fact NOT GOOD GAME DESIGN to have an area near the starting area, with the lowest tier enemies, get trolled into opening a treasure chest, have it teleport you to an area THAT YOU CANNOT TELEPORT OUT OF, yes even the first campfire near that area cannot be teleported out of, so if you have no gear, no horse, well you just need to start a new save now. Cool great design.  They really respect the player's time with this crap.  Also I know this genius mechanic I'm next going to talk about is present in all Soulscrap games, but how in the world is it good design to just permanently lose all your experience/gold if you die and can't get back to your death spot?  That isn't fun, it only angers you, depresses you, and wastes your time.  I'd be halfway fine with having to fight the same enemies over and over again, but when you have the added bs of just losing all of your experience it just isn't good game design.  Period.  And you're wrong if you think otherwise, objectively wrong.

The Souls formula doesn't benefit at all from the open world format, and what you have are long horse riding sessions through an unimpressive world full of a lot of green plains and rocks, with the occasional ruin.

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,4,"Honest review X hours in:

If you were expecting them to balance enemy damage in proportion to their health and mobility, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

If you were expecting them to finally realize they already had a sensible poise system in Dark Souls 1 and to stop trying to fix what was never broke, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

If you were expecting them to stop gimping blocking in most boss fights in favor of rolling like they did in DS3, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

If you were expecting them to learn how to do enemy grab attacks reasonably (i.e. not generally obnoxious with regards to damage and homing), you're going to be sorely disappointed.

If you were expecting them to cut back on every single enemy having a wombo combo that can chunk your health, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

If you were expecting them to cut back on staggered attack animations that give enemies the ability to hit you anyway unless you empty your stamina bar rolling and generally make evasion harder than it needs to be, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

If you were expecting them to realize that giving AI controlled enemies the ability to parry with absolute perfection would only result in unfair deaths to the player via 1 shot, you're going to be sorely disappointed

If you were expecting them to figure out that denying a player their full potential by limiting it with a consumable effect that is lost when you die (Rune Arc in this case, Cinders in DS3) is an asinine idea with exactly 0 merit, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

If you were expecting them to make a primary feature (lock on camera) finally be more a help than a hindrance, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

If you were expecting them to handle fall damage well, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

If you were expecting them to make it so you can't be hit and killed when you're not able to actually control your character (being pancaked, etc), you're going to be sorely disappointed.

To expand a bit further, I've personally just started referring to the design philosophy that seems to guide FS as ""Anti-player"" or **** the player"". I say this because for the 3rd game in a row (I'm exempting Bloodborn from this castigation because it at least had the rally mechanic and other compensatory features) FromSoftware has hit on all the predictable trademarks that have come to dominate their poor design.

Every enemy has a wombo combo, i.e. a combo that hits for outrageous damage or # of hits. This compounds with the next 2 points heavily.

Every enemy can hit you regardless of where you are in relation to them because they can just 180, have exaggerated attack animations or just have an animation that involves them holding their attack, running up to you, and hitting you anyway, or any combination of the 3.

Every build that isn't fast and focused on dodging is made to feel vastly inferior because they refuse to acknowledge that they can't come up with poise systems that are better than what they had in Dark Souls 1.

The number of deaths I had to deal with because I literally could not move for various reasons in ratio to the ones that were genuinely my fault (and lord are they many) is actually staggering. You can get hit, rendered unable to move or roll or act, then hit again. Combined with aforementioned lack of balance around damage done to the player, you typically are not going to survive the second hit.

They fumble the open world aspect because there is negligible space between ""no fall damage"" and ""knee-shattering instant death"", they don't even restore your mounts health when you respawn.

Having recently replayed through Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 and Dark Souls 3 in their entirety, I'm left to draw one of two different conclusions:

Option A: They are unable to balance things properly just because, and that Dark Souls 1 being largely really well done in that regard was nothing short of a cosmic stroke of luck.

Option B: They simply don't care to, because again, their game design philosphy over the years has gone from ""tough but fair"" to **** the player""

"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,3,"How did this game score so highly......

Being just a rehash of the past FromSoft games, but with abysmal optimization and an even worse lack of innovation.

This game being able to score a 97 just proves that you do not have to be actively trying to move the genre forward or introduce new concepts. As long as you regurgitate the same thing again and again, with little to no change whatsoever, it doesn't matter as long as you have a rabid fanbase who treat every rehash as the greatest thing ever made.

If it was another AAA franchise with this kind of game launch, just imagine the backlash.

But I don't blame Miyazaki and Fromsoft, if the mass media and consumers had called them out on their crap since DS3, then maybe they would have explored new territory since then. They would have added something revolutionary, included impressive game mechanics...

It just amazes me how this thing is hailed as innovative. With the same game design since DS2, graphics from 2009, tedious and outdated gameplay mechanics, terrible animation quality, and a lack of improvement of enemy AI (the AI is even PS2 level AI since they do not act without you being in the area, and keep attacking areas you have already dodged).

God, RDR2 was actually innovative. It was  revolutionary landmark in open world design and storytelling, and it just got completely snubbed at major game awards and gets crapped on till today for trivial reasons.

If this thing can get 97, RDR2 shld get a 101, minimum.

No open world game developer should take any notes of game design from this game. It is already weak as it is.

If there is anything else for me to say, it is that any consumer or review outlet giving this game anything more than a 6 should not be allowed to judge a game's quality and degree of innovation.

The only thing redeeming quality about the game are aspects of the art design.

I really wish this game was 97 great.... I really wish.

I have now played more than 40 hours of Elden Ring. I killed two of the major bosses (out of three) and reached the Grand Lift of Dectus before I decided enough was enough.
First, what the game does well.
Feel and tone
It lets you get a feel for the game without throwing things in your face. This could have been done better, but it is nice to experience a game where, as you go through, more unfolds before you.
Bugs.
This game is quite well polished. It is relatively bug-free. In forty hours of gameplay, I only ran into one serious bug.
What the game does poorly.
Music.
Although the musical score is very nice, the music is poorly implemented. You know whether something is intended to be an easy fight or a hard fight, just based on the music, and it changes your tactics. When the music indicates this is meant to be a tough fight, you hang back and take stock a little to learn your opponents' moves.
Combat.
The combat is dull, repetitive, and cliché. You are playing in a Quick Time Event (QTE). In fact, the whole game is one long QTE. You see the horse rear back, hit dodge. You see the guy with the halberd pull their arm back for a lunging strike, hit parry. Every enemy has a slightly different indicator of what button to hit when, but they are all the same tactics.
Enemies.
They are all laughable and trite. Seriously, they are bad. It's like the game designers went to a five-year-old and asked them what a cool monster would be. ""Oh, a giant head, on a go-kart, that shoots flaming harpoons from its mouth…..""
Seriously? The creatures you encounter seem to have no relationship with each other. Some are animals, some are weird inanimate things, and some are people, but none seems consistent.
Gameplay.
The objective of the game is to kill three big bosses. The only indication you get as to where they are is that you get a little golden line at some respawn points that show you roughly the direction you need to go.
Death is an integral part of the game. Many people told me the game is good because it is so hard unforgiving. But it is probably the most forgiving game released in recent years. Death means nothing, nothing at all. If you die, you drop runes. But this doesn't matter, you can go pick them back up, and as you can run around most enemies, you can literally just run to where you died, pick them up, run to the nearest spawn point, let anyone pursuing you kill you. Now you respawn right here, with no enemies — as they also reset — and pick up your runes. It's pointless.
Consider this to a more traditional game. If you die in a more traditional game, you have to load your previous save. The experience, money etc, you got is gone. Every enemy you killed is alive again. In
Atmosphere.
The game is void of anything worthwhile, there are numerous tilesets, but they don't do anything different to each other, just look different. The world is devoid of content, vapid at best. You have virtually no people, no characters, no justification for anything being anywhere. It's just a perpetual rule of cool. Lovely ruins, why are there? Who knows, there's no lore about it. There's no perceived purpose for the building. It's just there.
Not only this, the world is big and empty. You can spend ages just running from place to place, no fighting, nothing interesting to look at, nothing interesting to do, just run.
Character creation.
Wow, this takes the cake, you get given the choice of three classes, with no explanation about the differences between the classes, and you begin at level 8, and none of it is explained or even makes sense.
NPCs.
The NPCs you meet in the game are quite frankly **** They give you no reasoning as to why they are there. They are all tropey to the point of making my teeth hurt, and, for the most part, they would have been just as compelling if they were a roadside sign that you had to read.
Lore.
I like the lore, but it's here instead of what they did well because the lore has virtually no intersection with gameplay. Every item gives you snippets of lore. If you want it all, be a completionist and collect everything.
Story
Well, no, the story is crap. The story, in essence, is that you are at a tipping point, and how you level up your character is meant to reflect the tittering balance of the world around you. But you don't have a story here. The story is found in the lore, which undercuts the entire game but never intersects with it. There is no story in the gameplay.
Conclusion
Is Elden Ring good? No. It's trite, repetitive; boring; large, but not full; lacking consequence and impact. It's flagged as an RPG, but it isn't you don't play a character. All you do is allocate stats. You don't make choices that matter; you go through the motions. It is an entirely linear game in a non-linear environment, and it suffers because of it.",2,8

.Open areas full of nothing but monsters that barely defend themselves and the eventual big ones that 1 shot you even with high HP and level
.The balance is by far the worst in the series, big field monsters and even some normal enemies hit and resist more than bosses
.Open world is only an excuse to get items for the crafting table that you will never use and join the dungeons the franchise always had, making it a useless addition that will be there only to waste your time

"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"So I think this will be my very first legit review ever and let me just say this game is everything it's been praised and more. First of all I don't think people who give it bad reviews based on their computers specs and crashes should even be valid as I myself don't have the best CPU out there, but would never downplay a game when my hours played would be close to none. If you aren't familiar with FROMSOFTWARE (i.e. Bloodborne, Dark Souls, Sekiro) games either and just hopped on the hype train of what's popular and got slapped in the face with that difficulty shock don't take it with a grain of salt it's meant to challenge you. People also out there like ""There's no open world or Lore or Loot"" I don't know what you're talking about cause there's literally loot and lore all over if you actually explore and pay attention. Yeah there's no tutorial or quest page to guide you when playing or to hold your hand but you can always also use Google like almost 99% of everyone when they get stuck somewhere or just look up a guide and don't feel ashamed there's literally tons of info out there on the game to easily guide you by without needing a in game tab. Everything about his game is rewarding, from killing that crazy hard boss you are just determined to finish whether you die 100+ times or not. You can respec your character later in the game so even if you find something you want to use which you didn't build your char for you can always alter later on or if you really feel like it just grind it out like most games require these days as there's no real max level in the game as opposed to skills capping out at 99 which you can actually get every attribute to if you really wanna be Elden Lord.

The game had some flaws at launch but then again almost every game now and days days one has some sort of broken system to it which usually gets fixed right away or down the road. One major thing about this game no matter how much you might think you're a video game god is you're going to die.. Numerous, numerous times. Laugh it off, learn from your mistakes and move on. I've never clapped my hands so hard and yelled so loud to myself in excitement after getting down that boss I thought was ny imposible.

Graphics aren't as good as one would expect from a AAA game coming out in 2022 with 10/10 reviews and no it doesn't have DLSS or Ray Tracing or anything but you also have to understand it's all about the gameplay and it still looks pretty damn beautiful if you ask me.  I haven't got a chance to wander the lands with a friend yet but I heard it can be even more of a blast in co-op which I'm interested to try.

Also if you're finding it super hard but also enjoying it yes their are trainers and cheats out but honestly that takes away all the fun from the whole game plus then you get put in a Soft server with other cheaters so it's just not worth it if you ask me.

The game is clearly meant for consoles so I do recommend if playing on PC to have some sort of Controller to make your gameplay a lot smoother and easier much like most console released games.

All in all. If you were waiting for a new RPG you could just play by yourself or with others on your own time similar to games like Witcher 3, Nier Automata, RDR2 and etc with lots to explore, numerous endings to unlock, New Game +'s to catch anything you missed the first time or so on and wanna just be your own badass hero whether it's wielding a Giant sword, Shooting Bows, Casting Spells or basically doing almost anything you could in the likes of Skyrim then give it a shot.

My biggest piece of advice before purchasing is just know like most others have noted of the games difficulty and don't let it frustrate you do the point of quitting. The game basically comes at you with no difficulty setting but similar to very difficult versions or your favorite games you might be used to playing on Normal or even Easy and just aren't used to the challenge cause you just wanna enjoy and finish it. Don't aggressively attack enemies without properly dodging or blocking, it's not meant to just smash the hit button and heal.

Lastly just take your time, we're not all speedrunners out to smash records. You get no rewards in finishing it in one hour or one week. Chances are you're just gonna miss out on more stuff along your run.

Anyways I just wanna say I've loved every second I've spent with this game so far and can't wait to New Game plus it numerous times to learn and discover more and more. Coming from someone who's died hundreds of times enjoy everyone!! :D",1,4

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,5,"This is my biggest video-game-disapointment ever.
A dark souls game of extreme quality, that has been opened for the casual gamer. That was my expectation. Now, 30 hours of later, im deinstalling, and am not going to ever play this, nor buy any From Software game ever again...

Honestly: I regret the 30 hours of frustration i had, and the hilarious amount i paid for it.
It basically is just a fighting simulator. There is nothing more in this game. Run around, fight difficult to impossible (for me) battles, grind endlessly, progress extremely slowly, and, from time to time, discover items that may or may not be useful for you.
You will die a lot, lose all character progress regulairly, and generally, have no idea what this game is actually about. The story is non-existent, the world is extremely lifeless, and just filled with enemies that wait only or you, and the storyline will come to an end pretty fast, because you will just not be able to beat the bosses. At least, if you are a casual gamer iike me.
Which forces you to battle easy opponents forever, as rewards and character developement are hardly more than a cosmetic feature.

Of course there are ways to exploit the game, but as soon as i need youtube in a tab to achieve any chance of progression, a game has failed for me.

My last experience in this game, after exploring the whole starting region desperately, was a sorceress who finally enabled me to learn new spells. Which gave me hope, that the torture had come to an end.
And guess what: Those spells are far weaker than the weak ones, that you start with. Its a slap in the face, and im sure, that its an intended one.

Теперь к игре: ER - это тот случай, когда ты получаешь управления из 3-й дарки, механики 2-й (например теперь можно любое оружие как во 2-й дарке взять 2-мя руками) и пылающий ракетный двигатель как в любой игре FS. И поверьте мне, вам оооочень повезет , если вы не сдохните от каменной гусеницы которая взрывается как осколочная бомба ,когда вы проходите рядом. Ну ладно, то такое, а вот что больше радует это то, о чем я так мечтал в 3-й дарке - открытый мир в стиле студии. И тут все высший пилотаж - рандомные события, влияние погоды на разные типы магии, смена дня и ночи с разными типами мобов и даже!!!Ночными боссами!!! Единственное нарекание к игре, это то, что нужно сидеть вместе с блокнотом и записывать в него находение квестового перса и какой у него квест, так как иногда о нем тупо забываешь. И вы не подумайте, мне нравится , что они никак не отображаются и дают ток направление, куда нужно идти ( я играл в морровинд и обливион) , но вот мой блокнот надо было б поместить в игру и возможность купить его у торговца за 100 душ. Опции добавить в него 2 :
- Записать что-то.
-Зачеркнуть написанный текст.

Но ни в коем разе не добавлять этот ""классический дизайн квестов ассасина или скайрима"". Хотя в одиссее мне понравилось, что можно выбрать возможность только по ориентирам находить нужную локацию, но вот подсветка объекта на определенной дистанции с помощью орла я считаю лишней.

The camera itself makes me ill. Literally physically ill, I threw up after playing for only a hour and I'm afraid of going back in.

I don't know what I'm doing and why.
Seriously, this is like a fighting simulation?  Random enemies walking around in each area, so I go and fight them, they either turn out to be easy or nearly impossible.  So I die, start from last check point, and don't go that way or run away.
So I try to find a different location , hoping I can do something, which of course, kill some monsters , but I am losing the point, because they will respawn anyway as soon as I leave. So... what am I doing? Just go around and kill whatever be killed?
Maybe i was hoping to have more content, more purpose. Other reviewers said, the game is huge, but if this is what I supposed to do for 100s of hours, sorry this isn't gonna hold up long.

I generated FPS and frametime graphs, tested a lot of graphical settings at 1080p, 1440p and 4K, tested the game in 3 different setups, and the results where equaly disappointing on all of them.
This game has a lot of optimization issues, like, it is a pretty mediocre game in this regard, 4K, 1440p or 1080p, in every resolution I get the same stutters in the same areas, the same illogical frame drops, even if I try messing around with some settings.
Graphics wise, it seems like a 2013 game, and I can't even deffend this game even If I tried doing so. It has mediocre physics and AI.
Elden Ring is capped at 60 fps, and you can't disable V-Sync and it doesn't even have support for 21:9 resolutions. Really?
This game has some of the worst controls I've seen in a Soulsborne game ever, I had to reasign every key to make this game playable, and even then, it was pretty confusing, because the game uses controller mapping for every menu and tutorial, making it difficult for non-controller gamers.
And its 2022, why can't this game have technologies like FSR or DLSS? They would make the game much more accessible for different hardware configurations.
It's an open-world game, but you can barely interact with the world, you can't swim, you can't climb. And the world is plain, it has an amateurish design, something that would be decent around 5 years ago, but in 2022, its mediocre.
I have a lot more things i could criticize, but that would make this a lot longer, so I will stop here. The game is full of bugs, physics, AI and performance issues, so I can't recommend buying this game right now. If you MUST play it, I'd recommend doing it in a PS5.",2,9

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"I have never played any of the Souls games before, but being a connoisseur of RPGs and hearing of this supposedly legendary RPG series I felt it was time I finally bit the bullet. I figured with Martin penning the game's story it would be rather grand involving political intrigue and riveting tales of man's inner folly. Having grown up on D&amp;D and CRPGs I expected to have a fair idea of what I was getting into.

Much to my surprise, I found a vast open world filled with nothing to do. I created my character to wander around some lifeless void. Oh, it looks rather grand the art direction is quite phenomenal though the textures muddied and the game is plagued with pop-ins as well. I am able to forgive the occasional jank for a good and true RPG. I however did not find one in this game. I'm not sure what constitutes for an RPG these days amongst the general public, but generally it's a game with roleplaying options of which this game seems to have none other than building your character's stats and skills.

All problems are solved through this game's languid, ponderous, and clunky combat. No non-combat or social options in this supposed RPG. The exploration as as dull and lifeless as the world in which it inhabits. Some scant crafting materials to create some mediocre items with minimal stat gains. Undoubtedly the usual carrot and the stick seen in the MMO sphere influenced this trash itemization.

The dungeons were quite interesting and a more linear experience and I killed Margit after ten or twelve tries. The game's molasses combat was made even more frustrating due to the various technical issues that plague this supposed RPG (Hint it's not an RPG it's just combat pornography) Your character's hitboxes are far too large causing the enemies to strike you frequently when you're clearly outside of their swing radius. There's also numerous frame rate drops making the game's sole feature of combat extremely difficult since the technical execution of the developers lack of talent is holding you back further than the difficulty of the game is.

All in all this game is not an RPG, there are no roleplaying options. It's just combat pornography for the youth's violent masturbatory sadist rituals. If you have any class avoid this buggy mess like the plague it is and cast it into the fire! I for one got a full refund from my local gamestore, but I hope to save others the expense. We all know this game doesn't deserve a perfect score.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,1,"After spending a couple hours trying to troubleshoot black screen after starting the game and reinstalling everything, I finally made it to the world of Elden Ring. Unfortunately, that was a short trip. If you are a fan of souls-like games or games that are incredibly challenging, you will probably like this one, too. However, this is absolutely not a game for a casual gamer such as me. Different classes at character creation are not explained. The tutorial area is unintuitively hidden in a cave, and the tutorial itself throws at you so many mechanisms that are impossible to keep up with. Once you (die to ""tutorial boss"" and) leave the area, the very first thing you face is yet another boss. A boss that will one-hit you, and throw fast unexpected combos, while taking very little damage. After 30 minutes of fighting that boss I still was not confident in any combo sequence, my movements still felt very clumsy and slow, and camera control is really, really difficult.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,2,"Let's start off by saying I'm a huge fan of Dark Souls. Now that we have that out of the way, let's get into the core reason for a 2/10... Performance and proper PC support. Gameplay for this game, as well all know, is excellent; however, the lack of proper attention to the PC release has ruined the experience for many. Everything from CTD at launch, to launching into a blank white screen, variable stuttering on everything from low to high-end systems, lack of widescreen ""support"" (they render black boxes over the edges, yet the game still renders behind those just fine), lack of vsync toggle, an artificial framerate limit (some claim animations are tied to framerates, yet it's been unlocked by breaking EAC), among other issues.

With all the games recently launching on PC with abhorrent issues, gamers can't let it slide anymore. It's 2022 and this game launched without proper ultrawide and superultrawide support, things supported by various games on smaller budgets going on 20 years ago. This is the first mainstream game (don't kid yourself stating that a multi-million seller is ""niche"") that I can recall that not only does this, but doesn't have a vsync toggle and caps framerates on PC.

It's pretty clear that FromSoftware put minimal effort into their PC release. It's bad enough to have those issues, but to have crashing issues plaguing so many and horrid stuttering due to them not optimizing their shaders when they have such a huge budget is just a shame. Lord knows if they'll ever fix it either, as they didn't really address much with Dark Souls 3. Unlike Dark Souls 3 though, we have Easy Anti-Cheat to contend with, which disables our ability to apply community made mod fixes to address the issues. So now we're reliant on a developer that's historically disconnected from their fans on PC, as evidenced by their past releases.

I gave them 3 days to address the lack of ultrawide at least, and all they did was send out a patch to ""fix"" stuttering that didn't resolve stuttering and actually caused the white screen issues. Since then I have refunded the game and will not return until they fix all other issues. If they fix all the issues, then I'll update my review accordingly.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"It's like if Cat Mario was the only Mario game, sure some people have the time to die over and over again, but that's just not how the modern gaming works, give us normal mario.

Big monster dodge-and-roll games have been done before. It's based on archaic outdated game design. Give us something new and innovative.

Elden Ring does nothing to improve upon similar games, besides a minor graphics refresh. Just like COD and FIFA.

Ask yourself - Is the game actually fun to play or is it just fun to finally kill the big monster after dying 100 times? If 90% of the game isn't fun, it's not fun. Is it too much to ask to be having fun for most of the time while playing?

The gaming industry is a lot bigger and more accessable than when previous difficult games were released. Game reviewers need to take that into consideration, niche millennial games deserve low scores, or at the very least a very clear warning that it's probably not worth playing unless you've played previous Souls-like games.

Plus all the menus, interfaces, and controls are counter-intuitive and awful. Have they played any popular modern game?

They should be getting low scores for the controls alone - Space should be jump, Shift should be Run, C or CTRL should be Crouch, M should be Map, and TAB should be for regularly used menu items.

Just admit that you want to play more dark souls, don't pretend it's a good game worthy of new players picking it up.",2,10
"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"General
* Mounted Fall damage is completely inconsistent, making the dumb jump pads (?HORSE TRAMPOLINES???? MY IMMERSION. WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS WORLD.) seem even more pointless in comparison.
* The game allows you to ""equip"" gear you ""can't"" use without adequately explaining or notifying you how much its actually impairing you. (Accidentally press a few keys fumbling through the ported interface and equip a sword that looks just like the one you were already using, but apparently you're too weak to hold right? Your damage will suffer and you'll just go on thinking all these bosses have lots of armor and health.)
* Crashes alt tabbing a lot.
* The lack of focus the game exhibits really gives the impression it's been rushed and is not groundbreaking in any way, infact, taking several steps back. It's laughable to have no explanation or training for the core mechanics, but you'll receive a popup blurb you have to click through advising you some stupid side quest NPC will accept some dumb item you just received for a pointless endeavour. How about the game introduce itself to us before asking us to babysit?

Interface
* There's no keybind listing for ""open map"" if you open controls/bindings, so if you don't know what the binding is and are new to the game series, you never use the map. The first time I noticed an npc telling me they ""marked it on my map"", it didn't remind me what hotkey to push.
* You cannot press the UNIQUE map hotkey again to close the map.
* No explanation what the more esoteric stat names really do, or even what the simple ones do other than gear equip requirements.
* You can't keep moving while using the map, unlike every other aspect of the interface.
* It takes a long time and a lot of navigation to leave the game their ""intended"" way.
* Why is the inventory UI so **** - scrolling horizontally in a menu to select which category of item I want to mouse over and view in my bags? Why am I scrolling through 10 item types every time I obtain some stupidly named item to try and figure out what the **** I just looted?

Gameplay
* ELDEN RING's mounted combat and controls manage to make Trial of the Crusader jousting dailies feel great in comparison.
* Mounted combat auto locking on and circling requires an enormous amount of finesse to fight against the steering wheel, per se.
* Speaking of, how is it that I have over an entire page of crafting material but don't know how to use it yet? Game, are you there?
* Runes rewarded from creatures make no sense? Getting very low runes from tougher creatures has made trying to fight stuff that is challenging not really worth the time.
* For whatever reason rolling feels worse than before, oh well I guess I designed the wrong character with stats I dont understand and equipped something that is encumbering me but **** me because the game isn't telling me that, for damn sure.
* Why is the horse with the dumb named so influential to the game? It isn't satisfying to use the horse and all of its clearly overpowered and hamfisted ****
* Can't figure out the weird weapon special ability flourish enhancement enchantment imbuement Ash of War or whatever the **** it is system. It's like Materia or something right? I don't know, it didn't give an explanation.

World
* Is the expectation for a ""FROM SOFTWARE"" game that you use a player-created internet guide while you go through the game otherwise you're not playing it the intended way?
* The open world isn't very rewarding, I stopped looting flowers and berries after the 50th of each type. Lots of areas with enemies and different types of camps or castles don't give you anything.
* Story takes itself way too seriously considering it's the same formula..who cares that george martin is involved? Broadly speaking, this is the exact same brush used to fill in the story of the previous souls games. We're dis-eased souls (TARNISHED!) fighting to regain my HUMANITY or purity or grace or whatever it is, lighting Bonfires err Grace torches along the way... it's an identical story and Azerite Power has just been renamed to Runic Power.
* PS even the ""good areas"" are downright depressing. Game might literally be sucking my soul away with its vibe.

Universe
* Why are there so many identical assets from earlier Dark Souls games? Is this just a Chinasoft clone and a hodgepodge mish mash of all ""FROM SOFTWARE"" game design concepts at the same time?
* Standing by my earlier appraisal that ELDEN RING feels like a rushed expansion to an earlier Dark Souls and it isn't a ""very good"" standalone game, it's mediocre at best.
* Can't say its because I don't have patience to explore, I enjoyed over 200 hours of Arkane's Prey (a game that actually is a masterpiece, unlike ELDEN RING)
* This is Sunk Cost Fallacy: The Game. ""Maybe after 12 hours I'll figure out what the **** I SHOULD be doing... okay, I'm 20 hours in, I guess I have to beat this so it didn't beat me.""",2,10
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,6,"Its the worst souls game in the series (including sekiro / bloodborne) but its still a souls game so its fun. Get it if the performance ever gets fixed. Here are the biggest issue:

godawful performance - atrocious
game looks awful on low settings, some of the ugliest shadows ive ever seen, some of the worst performance offenders (like weather) cant be turned off
reused assets - a lot of them - multiple bosses are the same / show up as regular enemies (treebosses 4+ times!!!), certain dungeon ""parts"" get reused more than 3 times!
the horse is bad - some bosses basically force you to use it but especially hitting enemies with shorter (e.g. sword) weapons off horseback is incredibly imprecise
there is a LOT of dead open world but its somewhat tolerable - the map is quite good! If there is nothing on the map to see then theres nothing there to find either so theres really no point of searching every corner (which is contrary to how souls games usually work)

A lot of the pve bosses and enemies are much weaker than in regular souls games with the exception of the ""Elden Ring"" bosses.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"The game is being slammed for (almost) no reasons. Most of the time, the players that I've seen complain haven't made the nvidia driver update, or checked that the game is running using the graphic card instead of the processor's graphics. If that's your case, you definitely should try doing so before adding the review.

As far as the game's content is concerned, it is a masterclass. Althought the graphics are somewhat outdated, the artistic direction is just incredible, and it is the most important point in my opinion.

The gameplay is just as good as the previous souls game, with new mechanics which integrate just well, and reward playing aggressively, to break the poise of the boss and deal huge amounts of damage. You have many options and ways to play.

The story and lore are really interesting, although mysterious, which might deter some, but is really rewarding if you love digging into the game's mysteries. The bosses are really good too, some of them being just insane, and will probably end up being just as cult as Sullyvahn or Gael.

And to finish with, the most important part, which is the open world aspect, is also it's strongest point. You have a total freedom, like in breath of the wild. But where it stands out, in my opinion, is regarding the loot. Your exploration truly is rewarded, as most items you find are unique, giving a true feeling of finding something precious each time, be it a weapon, a spell, a npc, an invocation, an armor, a unique item... The game also always surprises you, with unpredictable events happening regularly, which is great for an open world, as I often find that a routine quickly settles in in most open worlds. Not in this one.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"Personal opinion:

The way ANY game performs is a necessary condition for me to enjoy such a game - it doesn't suffice to make an otherwise bad game enjoyable but it provides a set of conditions that allow me to proceed evaluating other aspects such as gameplay, art style or story. If it doesn't perform well, it really doesn't matter whether it is an artistic masterpiece redefining the medium or a cheap shovelware, I simply don't care.

The former is the case of Elden Ring for PC. The game might indeed be a critically-acclaimed masterpiece, yet it performs so badly I struggle to enjoy ít regardless of how fascinating piece of work it is.

Imagine having a PC that runs comparable gaming titles at 1080p and stable 60FPS when applying the highest graphical preset available. I've built my PC with the exact same consideration, to run most of the games flawlessly using these conditions. There are many demanding, resource-heavy titles my PC is too weak for to run flawlessly using the settings, yet the games from the same branch such as Elden Ring are certainly not the ones among them. I can run Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order - a game that looks much better than Elden RIng - flawlessly, and the same applies to Sekiro - a game that looks basically the same as Elden Ring and that uses a slightly modified engine and shares similar assets/elements.

However, in order to enjoy this game at 1080p and stable 60FPS when applying the higest (or just high!) preset, you not only need to wait for the developers to release a patch that will likely eliminate the omnipresent stuttering that is common across the whole spectrum of PC configurations (yes, all the users regardless of their rigs are affected), you also have to own a PC that was built with at least a 1440p type of gaming in mind. That is, you are expected to own now very expensive GPUs/CPUs to enjoy the game in a way a user with regular mid-tier PC configuration enjoys most of the current games available. So you have to lower your demands to play the game flawlessly unless you own a super-expensive GPUs such as 3080 Ti or 3090.

I don't like this attitude and I refuse to speculate whether it is an incompetence of the developers or some hidden intentions leaking from underneath, it really doesn't matter at the end of the day.

Bad optimization is a bad optimization. To all the players in denial - the stuttering is probably going to be fixed soon with the upcoming patches but the resource-heavy, poorly optimized segments of the game causing your performance to suddenly go from 55-60s to 30s/40s, not. So you better spend at least $1K to upgrade your GPU or purchase a PS5.",1,6

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,1,"I have never played a From Software game before, so this will be a new player perspective.

First of all, the game looks interesting and cool. That's why I decided to buy it. But going deeper and deeper into this game, it shows its flaws.

So starting the game something that stood out for me was the bad performance on PC. This was horrible from the start. Using my mouse and keyboard resulted in powerpoint like fps which was unplayable. So it forced me to play with the controller which fixed the problem somehow. Then still, the game is  capped at 60 fps with mediocre graphics for a game released in 2022, there's fps drops when exploring and fighting bosses. Even with a 6900xt, the fps sometimes hit as low as 15 for a couple of seconds.

Then there's the fighting. The enemy locking system is confusing and does not work properly most of the time. Getting hit by a boss attack while standing multiple meters clear of impact. Getting killed through the wall. Using the mount to fight is also very buggy and inconsistent and makes the camera shoot all over the place when getting close to terrain or enemies.

The biggest flaw in my opinion is the multiplayer co-op. I thought this would be like a whole play through co-op mode, instead it's just helping to kill the boss and bye my friend. This is not fun if you want to play with friends.

It feels like there is no story in this game, which is making the game feel a bit empty in my opinion. I think this also makes the game more confusing to new players since I have no clue what I am supposed to do and how to progress, get items, level up and so on.

The sound design is also not that good. The constant background music which stays the same the whole time you play, the buggy monster sounds and volume balance is just annoying.

The world design looks like they just had a pile of assets and threw them into the game without looking where they went. It's very messy with assets going through each other and a lot of cut off edges, especially when looking at the awful water.

The game doesn't even automatically change key prompts from keyboard/mouse to controller, the menus are weird layout wise and there's not that many graphics settings. Not that it matters because the game doesn't look good.",1,6

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"I don't ever give a zero on Metacritic, but I am for Elden Ring cause the game won't even launch if you use a controller. If you disable xbox controller configs and Steam input, then the game will launch, but hitting any controller button merits no response from the game. When you then swap to a keyboard, the game will permanently display controller buttons instead of keyboard keys, so you have no clue how to do anything.

There's no fix.

Having watched my fiance play it gives me more complaints. The game will often drop to the single digit framerates when you get too close to the border of a new major area of the open world and it will certainly end in your demise if you happen to be in a fight at the time. The PC the happens on is using an RTX 3090 and a Ryzen 5050X, so you can't blame the hardware. It's a well know problem that you can find via any google search from the very first result. Even bing finds it.

Furthermore the story is bland and has been used by dozens of other games and the character names are so bad they make me cringe. This is nothing but a reskinned, partially replaced 3d model  clone of Demon's Souls on PS3, just like every other souls game. There's nothing special about it and it doesn't even remotely deserve a score like metacritic gives it even when it's working.

This is a huge slap in the face to the truly great games who have upper 90s score, like the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Ocarina of Time, and others. I strongly suspect bribes went into this as well as a societal obsession with George RR Martin who only gets notoriety for managing to get full nudity and sex a dozens times per episode onto HBO. I suppose it saves on porn subscriptions. Personally, I'll choose the latter option any day. Porn stories are somehow less cringeworthy than Elden Ring's story and I could never in my life have imagined saying any story is worse than C-list porn.",1,7

Putting 5-10 hours into this game gave me both a skinking sense of deja-vu and the feeling of forcing myself to eat fistfuls of overly sweet cake.

If, like me, you have played this series since Demon's Souls, you will realise Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4. Or Demon's Souls 2 - It doesn't really matter at this point.

Other than the *slightly* more open world structure (the 'Souls series was always somewhat open in structure) and Torrent the goathorse, everything is exactly the same as all the previous games, including elements from Bloodborne and Sekiro.

Same player classes and animations?
Same enemy design, including enemy types/classes?
Same pseudo-mediaeval world, with lonely atmosphere?
Same dead-eyed, hollow-voiced NPCs?
Same controls and combat system?
Same telling of the opaque story and world lore through item descriptions?
Same, boring, grindy progression system?
Same die-and-die-again repetitive gameplay?
Enroaching feeling that you are wasting your life playing updates to the same game released well over a decade ago?

'Yes' to all of the above.

Mashing together your previous 4 games and adding a horse is in no way innovative or good, by any metric. This is one of the laziest 'masterpieces' I have ever seen.

It used to be fun, but its just the same bland thing over and over again.

All controls are designed for the console and the PC implementation is awful. Starting from basic things like the Escape key not being 'go back' in the menus, to essential combat maneuvers requiring 10+ minutes to google online.

Halfway through the tutorial [actually on an online forum], I learned that you need to tell the game you are not using a controller to get tutorial tips for the keyboard + mouse.

It would be incredibly simple to make sensible defaults for the keyboard (like using the numbers 1-9 to select weapons, spells or items), but no such effort has been made.",0,2

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"This game is frustrating and boring.  I can see where maybe some people would like it, but I imagine for most people it's going to suck.  There's little guidance overall, the tutorial is hidden in a hole, the first waypoint sends you to be murdered by an overpowered boss, there are no normal monsters to fight until after you've been filled by 1) an unkillable plot-armor boss and 2) the OR boss they guide you into, etc...    Not to mention the controls suck, since its a pretty clear console port.

Bottom line-- it's lame.",0,6
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Elden Ring has surpassed all of my expectations. The game is a perfect marriage between Dark Souls combat and Breath of the Wild exploration. To my pleasant surprise, Elden Ring was able to make world exploration the most enjoyable part of the experience for me. Being able to almost immediately unlock our horse companion makes the early game a wonderful time. There is something magical about riding through the world, enjoying the beautiful environment, and hunting for all of the secrets to be found. Again and again I was shocked by the diversity of world design, the depth of the dungeons, and the scale of the world itself. Elden Ring gives me a feeling that no other game has; the feeling of walking through an area with the sense that I've been here before. This chilling sense of nostalgia alongside the outstanding depth of combat options is the reason why I will be returning to Elden Ring for years to come.",0,1

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"One of the best games ive ever played. And im gaming since Atari 800XL/C64 times.

The world is so amazing, with so much fredom, that i have to think a long time to find another game that lets one that many choices what to do first. Cant beat boss XY? Just go to ZY. Cant beat ZY, just go to YZ. Cant do YZ, just do thing ZZ.

Every corner of the immense world is full of secrets and content. Even after reading 10 guides one still will find secrets on his own, if looking for them, trying out things etc.

Controls are like always in Souls games, spot on. One can count beats and it will fit, if the refresh rate is constant.

Bosses always give that immense feling of accomplishment, even if not that hard as in other Souls games. The ""choosable"" difficulty of them makes this a perfect example how a Soulsbourne has to be, playable by everyone who invests time into the game. Everyone can choose how hard he wants it to have, by either just following the ""line"" or by roaming the world, doing it all before going to the hard bosses.

Technically i dont have the issues others have, so i cannot rate it down. After the latest patch the game runs on vsync 60 fps on maximum, if i let the first few minutes after loading in out of the calculation. Its very fluid (9900k, rtx 2080, 32gb, win 10, wqhd).

Many nice features make this Souls for my personal taste the best one. The open world, the horse and the ability to jup improve it by a ton.

I dont understand why ppl rate it low, honestly, im afraid they are the ones rating everything down.

For me its among the best games of the last years, maybe even for overall. Its amazing and  i cant stop it once ive started.

If i would have 1 wish for something to be added, i would choose a bit more story. In form of cutscenes or whatever. I know there is lots of lore etc but sometimes i wish there would be a bit more.",0,2

The story as well, highly missable, highly optional. the difficulty is definitely a matter of taste but the difficulty spikes is just like the game itself: an absolute stumble fest. people enjoy the game, because the open world is EASY and gives the illusion of approachability, but for every new weirdly designed boss or miniboss encounter that euphoria drops into the pit of realization that this game just started throwing **** together and people eat it due to the established git gud syndrome.

Yes there are some framerate issues on the PC, but even with it's few flaws this game keeps making me ask the question, ""Is this the best game of all time?""

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"This game is one of the most highly-anticipated games in recent memory, and it certainly lives up to expectations. I'll keep it short and simple. I am ~20 hours in and could not be happier with this game.

Pros:
- Visually impressive. I don't think this game has state-of-the-art graphics, but that isn't really something I care about. The graphics are solid, the world is beautiful, and the art direction is phenomenal
- Combat is fun and engaging. Like previous FromSoft games, the combat is a high-point. Git gud.
- Exploration is risky but rewarding. I am thrilled with their addition of dungeons and crafting. There are interesting storylines, secrets, and puzzles all around- you just have to look.
- Difficulty is present and the game is better for it. This game pushes its players to be better and smarter. This is something rare but deeply appreciated in today's videogame market. I applaud FromSoft for not trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

Cons:
- Some performance issues initially. They were never that bad for me, though. I know that other PC users struggled, but all I experienced were some occasional slow-downs and frame-rate drops. Following the most recent update, it runs flawlessly.",0,2
"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"The launch had some bugs on pc and this is clearly a console port, but overall this is one of the best games I have ever played. I am 98 hours in, and almost done with the game. This was my first souls game, though I have played other similar games that are less difficult.

I think my favorite thing about this game is the sheer variety in how you can tackle it. There are so many viable options, and the most OP of them seem to have been, or will be nerfed to be more appropriate. My friends all use different builds and weapons, and we have all had such different experiences going into it. There is a level of freedom and exploration that Breath of the Wild started and Elden Ring expanded on substantially.

It's not going to be for everyone, it's definitely hard, and unforgiving but fair most of the time. You can be a sweaty if you want, you can use summons and have friends help, you can be a mage, a 2h warrior, a stealthy rogue style build, the options and new game plus really do lend themselves to an expansive varierty.

One of the best games I have ever played, truly a 10/10 game, and a breath of fresh air in a AAA environment where microtransactions and overly busy HUDs gimp what could otherwise be solid games.",0,1

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,2,"Honeslty the worst game I've ever played. Was kinda hyped by being an open-world, for the great reviews but this game is yet another example of how the review's aren't to be trusted nowdays. You beggin the game, nest thing you get is ultra hard boss, very hard to beat. Game gives you literally no pointers.

It is VERY hard to play it, but it's an ""artificial"" difficulty, sometimes boss don't even hit you and removes half of your HP, makes no sense. In my experience, Dying Light 2 (for example) was kinda harder, in a sense that you, the average player will have a good challenge with it but at the end you'll feel accomplished you beat the boss or whatever and you'll keep playing. This game? Straight up impossible. It's not rewarding at all, it's just annoying, and after 8 hours of work last thing a person who's stressed during the day needs is game of this kind. I understand that some people like it, but many gamers got tricked by the reviews and the metascore. This isn't mean for the mainstream gamer, it's meant for one who likes a challenge and has a controller or two laying around to break and a lot of patience.

Also, did the reviewers even test this crap? Performance is absolutely awful, I have a AMD RX 6600 paired with 32 GB 3600mhz and a AMD Ryzen 5600X and this game lags WAYYY too much and I don't even have the graphics set to maximum. This PC can run Cyberpunk 2077 Ultra without a problem.

TLDR: Don't trust the Metascore, don't know what happened to this getting 95/100, it trully doesn't deserve it. If you want a good open-world rewarding game to play in your free time, get Dying Light 2 or Cyberpunk 2077, this is just bad.",0,2

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,6,"If you've never played a Souls game, PLEASE do not start with this one. Every other game in the series is a better place to start, I worry that for someone who starts with this game, they'll miss out on the rest of the series because hey, this is the newest one so it MUST be the best. It's not, it's near the bottom of this great series. Maybe at the bottom entirely.

So... another Souls game. Not saying that's a bad thing. The combat is fair and challenging, the presentation is solid, the graphics are... alright, certainly not 2022 stuff (unless this is just a bad PC port... which now that I look over the reviews, it sounds like I got off light, it just looks old and blah, it's not stuttering *anywhere* near as bad as many are experiencing)

This is not a bad game, 7/10 is not a bad score. It's alright... but I'd wait for it to be on sale for like $20... While it retains many of the elements that made prior Souls games great, what it cuts out was essentially the heart and what it adds in simply doesn't work. The open world is boring, the enemy placement is lame, I didn't feel any sense of wonder or world building that even comes close to the rest of this series. The game feels rushed and more like From was told to make a game they didn't really want to make.

As a huge fan of Demon's Souls, Dark Souls and Bloodborne... I'm not disappointed per say... but I'm certainly not wowed either. I don't care for how open the game is, it really ruins what makes these games great. I don't care for the setting, take Bloodborne for example, the setting was the best thing about it. I don't care for the random hodgepodge haphazard placement of enemies, it honestly feels like an early 2000s MMO when you look at how things are laid out...I certainly would put this near the bottom, maybe just above DS2, in terms of souls games. That being said, 7/10 doesn't mean this is a bad game and DS2 isn't bad either. It's just not anywhere near their best work, which I'd recommend 10x over this title.

Again, not horrible but it's not worth $60 and From Software clearly didn't put much effort into this port. Sigh... maybe I am disappointed, writing this really made me feel that way.

6/10, skip it. 7 is too high of a score for how much of a fall from grace this is, especially with how bad the port is for PC.",0,1

That's where my issue with the game comes in. I do like the Dark Souls series, however with George R.R. Martin writing for this game, I was expecting a story rich adventure, in the world of a new franchise. Elden Ring does not feel like that new franchise offering a new experience which I had high hopes for. It's an ok game, but doesn't offer anything original.

If this does not sound appealing then again, this game is not for you.

What differs it from previous games is the world, which is not only open but manages to avoid the ubisoft formula. There are very few icons on the world map marking locations, and they only pop up once a location is discovered. There is no filler in the shape of find-all-flags or collect-all-logs and so on. There are no objective markers, a journal, quest log, character dossiers, collectibles etc. You are expected to pay attention to what NPC's are asking you to do, often indirectly and often in passing. I found this refreshing, as most games these days seem to be going out of their way to force you to experience everything they have to ofter, and they will remind you of the things you haven't, every time you open a map. When you discover a new location in ER, it's your discovery, rather than an inevitable stop on a theme park ride prepared by the devs. I liked it, would recomend it to a friend.",0,2

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"The PC launch was rocky for a couple days. I experienced lots of performance drops. However, with the recent Radeon drivers and updates, the game rarely dips on a Ryzen 3600 and 6700 XT.

The environments are better than any fantasy RPG that has been released to this point. Many of the vistas are like looking at a painting. This is highlighted by many of the in game paintings of the vistas in artist shacks. The artwork is fantastic, beyond anything other companies have attempted to do to this point.

From Software has mainly focused on decaying or dying worlds. This is also true for Elden Ring. Instead of having a ton of quests requiring logs and tracking, there are localized quests and a few long, story-driven quests to follow. Many of these take you to places you would explore on your journey. When NPCs talk about them, it is very likely you already have the location on your map. Joining factions often gives you the ability to teleport to their base.

The open world is expertly crafted. It leads you to where you need to go without annoying tracking systems that have plagued RPGs in the last decade. Many players will miss such systems, desiring for the game to tell them where to go. This game is more about exploration, and the exploration is rewarded well. Often with a new weapon, art, or summon.

Multiplayer in the game is integrated well into the game world. Invasions still occur, but only in multiplayer sessions. As you have seen from other reviews, the game is difficult and frustrating for some people to solo. If you want to play alone, around half of the optional bosses are tedious fights without over leveling or having a good build. Coop is necessary for many parts of the game. Coop is where the game shines. Use it. It is easy to drop in and help others or find players at many of the summon points throughout the game. Playing multiplayer opens you up to invasions, which provide a sort of miniboss for coop players. Many invaders come prepared with good builds, items, and arts. Rarely do they win though since they often face 3-4 players. At this point, everyone is packing some sort of weapon art or spell that will make quick work of another player. You have to be a better player to win.

Few games really integrate everything into a game so well. If you enjoy hard games, are willing to do coop, git gud, and enjoy exploration, then this is a good title for you. If you are looking for a single player MMO, then it isn't for you.",0,2

The game pits you against an overpowered enemy immediately to let you know you’re not ready. Go level up, learn the mechanics, then come back and kick his ass. That’s the hook. You earn every kill in these games.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,6,"Combat is excellent and bosses are fun to learn.  There are a bit more default attack moves which allow for more ways to approach every fight, not to mention the open world giving you more angles.  Cooperative is very fun given there's an immediate boss/objective before us.
Unfortunately the pacing isn't as good as the more linear Souls games due to some bad open world designs and how gathering materials has bloated the map.  Crafting and gathering is just not good.  I'd rather more materials be dropped from enemies instead of being gathered on the ground.
Sadly the open world adds considerably less content than the space it takes up and the introduction area doesn't do it any favors. The rewards for exploring aren't comparable to the effort it took to find and get there unless it's to progress the main story.  If there's no point of returning to an area why allocate such huge space for it?  This is without mentioning you cannot use mounts in co-op. The pace becomes incredibly slow at many times.
Luckily many of the enemies are engaging and rewarding to defeat. It makes you wonder why there is so much space between you and the actual fun.",0,1

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,0,"So my character says only 21 hours. Though, my hours should be around 27. This is because of saving not working. Well more so, save corrupting. I am a constant saver in video games, even if I don't go back all the time I'll make hundreds of save files. So I see a new zone in Elden Ring I walk into it so it saves, I see a grace I activate it to save(or rest), I talk to a vendor to save, etc. So, it annoys me that I lost 6 hours worth of my progress. Not to mention all the other glitches you have to deal with constantly.
Now to go on: one glitch rn is that most entities are just invisible. The only ones I've noticed not to turn invisible are the enemies that are so large that they have multiple lock on points and bosses, everything else is free range to turn invisible. Ohh you are on the road? Well I guess 4 knights are attacking you now. You wanted talk to a trader? Better remember where they sit.
Plus, it does not help when you get the glitch where your light attack does not want to work. At first I thought I broke my new controller that I just bought a month before Elden RIng came out, but then I tried to light attack with my mouse and it would not work. Heavy attack would work fine but light attack just was not having it.
Does not help to drop down to 2 frames every 5 seconds at some points or areas so you can not advance to certain points. Plus, the game just freezes for 5 to 15 seconds at a time like have a chill have some water. Which is weird that these things are happening as I am running on low graphics for everything, except grass which the lowest is medium and I put render distance to medium cause it actually ran better. Though, my pc is not the best I have put around $1000 USD worth of parts into it, but still it should not be like this.
This is not to big of a problem, but in areas with poison sludge when you are well out of the sludge and did not get the poison effect sometimes the effect will still build up so you will end up getting poisoned. if you're leaving an area, or just running through it quickly I can see it messing you up though.

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"The game is a masterpiece, and this review is directed towards people who are interested but hesitant because of the negative reviews. While I have experienced, some performance hiccups, they did not detract from my experience playing the game. I do not believe that they will remain in the game given some patchwork. If you have bought the game and have issues with performance, I can understand being disappointed, but I urge you to get a refund and withhold judgment on it. Come back at a later time, because this is going to be a timeless masterpiece and it would be a shame to not experience it in it's fullest. Games are very complicated and pretty much impossible to get running perfectly for everyone, but given time I believe they will  get the game running much better for people who at least have the required hardware or better. This belief is based on fromsoft's previous track record of having initial difficulty with PC ports and the sheer amount of effort clearly put into this game. They clearly care. I don't believe the game deserves criticism for how it presents its story, or difficulty. Nor do I believe it deserves criticism for not having the highest fidelity graphics.  This is not the game for you if you are looking for a game that has a lot of story to ingest, or doesn't require much of the player in general. There is nothing wrong with that, people are allowed to have their own interests, but that does not make the game a bad game. If you are interested in the visuals I would argue that, despite not being the most realistic or being the highest fidelity, Elden ring has presented me with some of the most, if not the absolute most, awe inspiring vistas and visuals I have ever seen in a game. I would also argue that Elden Ring is a game that prioritizes gameplay (as I believe all games should but that is my opinion), and if you believe that it shouldn't maybe it isn't the game for you, but that doesn't make it a bad game for it's target audience. As for people struggling with the difficulty, contrary to what a lot of people think the intention behind the game isn't explicitly to be difficult, but rather to present a meaningful challenge that is rewarding to overcome. It is about learning and thinking outside the box. There are plenty of ways to make encounters more manageable, they are however left for the players to figure out. Being hard doesn't make the game bad. This game is quickly becoming one of my favorite games ever, but it's not for everyone. That said not every game needs to be for everyone. I recommend the game, but I also recommend getting a friend to let you try it first if you are unsure. Games are about entertainment so find a game you enjoy and don't be mad at people for liking a game that isn't made for you.",0,2

As for the game in itself? Simply beautiful. After creating a second character I managed to find much more of the story content / NPC interactions which enriched my playthrough. I recommend buying information notes from the vendor in the game because it'll cue you in on some of the underlying richness of this world.
The game is hard but the world provides many avenues for players to progress.

There is so much more meaning in a game like Elden RIng. Just give your self a chance to try it. It is the closest thing to a DnD gaming experience, everyone has a different journey. The world is incredibly mysterious and rewarding, it's fair to say that nearly every corner of this nearly endless world has something hiding, something that most of the players could potentially never see or experience.

If they optimized the game a little I would definitely give it a ten out of ten. I have a pc that should have no trouble handling the game on max settings, but I still get the spikes even if I go on low settings.",0,2
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,8,"Im actually not surprised by the semi low reviews. The game is highly unoptimized as of release and maybe not the best looking one released in the past year. Its also not with might have been expected from a Fromsoft game. But as a game in itself its actually quite good.

First of all, I am a fan of the Souls games. I've played the Dark Souls trio and Bloodborne numerous times. I've played demon souls once and I've touched Sekiro. Part of the experience might be Influenced by nostalgia. I might add that I'm also a fan of the Elder Scrolls series. Why is this relevant?

The best way to describe the game is as if Dark Souls 3 and Skyrim had a baby. The Dark Souls signature playstyle in its complete form. Someone who played any of the DS games will easily adapt to the controls and gameplay basics. The difference is a jumping mechanism and the vast open world format. You have a horse that you can use for travel as well as combat. However most of the bosses are in mount restricted areas. All in all theyve made it work but at a cost. The world, as of 15hrs in the game, have a feeling of 'lifelessness' and the world is too large for its own good. If you played skyrim you might have had the same mixed feeling. One part of you loves the big, free, open and unrestricted world while another part of you is tired of walking another 10 minutes through a forest consisting of nothing but trees, or a tundra full of ice but nothing more to it. The world is not very interesting and sometimes gives me the Ubisoft 'far cry open world' vibe. You sometimes however stumble upon more in depth areas but my feeling is that they couldve cut the world size in half and still have the big size feeling but with more personality. Some locations feel synthetic in the way that they are added as filler or just to serve for a certain mechanic.

That leads me to the other problem. Dark souls, or the souls series in general, usually have a very abstract story where you have to puzzle the small hints of dialogue and cutscenes to find out about the huge lore and deep actual meaning of the game. Due to open world nature of the game and the lack of dialogue and cutscenes that comes with the somewhat unpersonalized open world, you get more distanced from the otherwise semi linear story. I personally don't care much about story in any games, souls game included. I play for the risk/reward, the exploration and the gameplay, therefor I don't find this downgrade of story that impactful. However I do miss the change of scenery and feeling of progress that you usually get in the more linear games.

Apart from these downsides or weak points of the game it good. The actual content and possible playtime and replay ability is huge. You have more alternatives than the previous games. More weapons avaliable. More abilities. More mechanics. Improved multiplayer. More to explore. I love some of the boss fights I've fought and that the difficulty varies. What might feel impossible at first will become easy as you progress the game and your personal skill. Also the art style and some of the architecture is great, as usual. If I could choose I would have wanted a more linear traditional ""dark souls 4"" but the Elden Ring, being a different attempt to showcase the souls series, does not make a bad job. It just doesn't do it in the way a souls fan might expect it.",0,2

"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Ce jeu est véritablement un chef d'oeuvre vidéo ludique et ce pour plusieurs raisons :
- Il possède une identité unique avec une DA exceptionnel
- Sa conception est dans l'ensemble extrêmement bien pensé (c'est difficile mais pas si frustrant grâce au level design soigné)

Maintenant, chacun interprétera la proposition différemment. Certains n'y verront qu'un jeu au graphisme et à la technique vieillit. D'autres se laisseront happer par l'univers et les combats exigeants mais toujours bien récompensés.

Personnellement, j'ai découvert un jeu qui bouleverse complètement mes habitudes. C'est original sur beaucoup d'aspects (le nombre de combinaisons possibles ! la diversité et le style des armes ! )  et change la formule des opens worlds habituels. On oublie les ficelles l'espace d'un instant pour se laisser happer par un univers riche et complexe, comme si nous étions à l'intérieur d'une pièce d'horlogerie. Et ça c'est extrêmement grisant !

De plus, la composante multijoueur, bien qu'assez déroutante au début est extrêmement bien intégré au jeu et lui donne une autre dimension (littéralement). Pouvoir jouer avec ses amis change tout et rend ce monde encore plus kiffant à parcourir.

Alors oui, le jeu a des défauts mais c'est aussi paradoxalement ce qui fait sa qualité. Pour reprendre les mots d'un philosophe, il a du style dans son caractère et je terminerai cette critique sur cet extrait qui vaut bien mieux qu'un long discours.

 Le Gai Savoir, *IV, 290, ibid., p. 172.** @Nietzsche
Une seule chose est nécessaire. -- « Donner du style » à son caractère -- c'est là un art considérable qui se rencontre rarement ! Celui-là l'exerce qui aperçoit dans son ensemble tout ce que sa nature offre de forces et de faiblesses pour l'adapter ensuite à un plan artistique, jusqu'à ce que chaque chose apparaisse dans son art et sa raison et que la faiblesse même ravisse l'œil. [...] Enfin, lorsque l'œuvre est terminée, on reconnaîtra comment ce fut la contrainte d'un même goût qui, en grand et en petit, a dominé et façonné : la qualité du goût, s'il a été bon ou mauvais, importe beaucoup moins qu'on ne croit -- l'essentiel c'est que le goût soit un.",0,1
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Elden Ring is the first big singleplayer game I have ever played for a considerable amount of time and it stunned me. There is so much to see and to experience, that the game has not gotten boring after 80 hours where I am not even close to 100%. Some great features I want to mention are following.1. Diversity in playstyles: Magic is powerful, Weaponarts are easy to use, there are a ton of different weapons, combat while riding is intuitive and can not be abused for every enemy 2. Exploration &amp; Open World: Despite of some other reviews I have read here, I think the overworld has much to offer. The areas are all unique with obvious high points in the bigger levels. Everywhere you go you find either a cave, a graveyard, some brutal bears, a merchant or even a random mini boss. And yes there is repeating content, however always with a need new aspect to it. The important loot, while quite often not useful for your specific build, is still almost always unique. 3. Design &amp; Graphics: Fromsofts design is great as usual. The big levels look stunning and even the huge open world has not to hide from anybody. And yes the repeating ruins and the thick fog everywhere sometimes seem like lazy design, yet they did not make my experience any worse. And yes graphics are not top tier. Still they are by no means bad. 4. Difficulty: The difficulty is not nearly at a level of the ds games. For me as a starter this was quite welcoming as it takes some time to learn all of Elden Rings mechanics. Whit constant exploration and without losing to much runes due to dying, leveling up is quite fast. A danger this poses is that you can get overleveled really fast. For some enemys this just makes the fights faster, others however can get hilariously easy (a boss in an main level died after three hits in my playthrough). Still almost any enemy can and will kill you in seconds if given the opportunity. There is also the option just to progress to other areas early. Most areas are not locked as to be expected from an open world. 5. Enemy's &amp; Bosses: Their complexity evolvs alongside the player. Basic knights fe. get more abilities in later areas. If you found a strategy for every enemy type they all are manageable. However ganks are deadly. (And mages **** your melee dude.) For the Bosses it is pretty much the same. With the right powerlevel they are all beatable. Some are made to easy by summons. And there are a bit many reskin mini-bosses. With just few alterations. 6. Controls on PC: I heard some complaints about playing without a controller. I can not confirm. With some keys changed controls still are not intuitive, yet they are also nothing abstract and are rather easy to learn. 7. Story and Npcs: Idk. They are either crazy, dead or gone. Seriously there are cool questlines and most of the npcs tell you a good portion of what you have to do, however you still either seem to need to Google some or just be lucky to progress at some point. For the lore it is probably the same. I feel like I have not grasped most parts of it. However I enjoy diving into lore analysis after finishing the game myself. Yes there are performance issues, however they seemed to correspond with other programs running, at least on my PC.In conclusion Elden Ring is by no means perfect, yet it still offers so much to anyone giving it a chance that I can not take any points away from my 10/10",0,1

"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Yes this is the one of a few games that i give a 10/10 score, I never been a Dark soul or Demon soul fan, not because of the difficulty (I love challenging game and I'm a big fan of Sekiro) but because how slow the movement is, and no jump!!!, it just not my cup of tea. I love Sekiro, challenging, awesome combat system, awesome bosses (so sad that there is no dlc for it) so when Elden ring came, I was really considering should I order it or not, and in the end I gave a try.

So? it is awesome, every complaints about Dark soul now is gone in Elden ring, the movement feel so smooth and you can jump (awesome). The world is beautiful, the graphic to be honest not at next level, but it is still beautiful, every lands, dungeons and runes are unique, the combat system is great, still I miss the posture and parry mechanic from Sekiro ( you can still parry if you get the right shield or weapon). Elden ring open world is one of the best period imo, you can explore every placer before the story route, even some of the area at the end game can be even explored very early, so it is also a very forgiving soul like game compare to previous From soft games.

It's been a while since I was so into a game like this, spent around 60 hrs already, and this is easily GOTY for me, I downloaded this together with Horizon forbidden west in PS5 and after playing Elden ring, i feel Horizon is a bit boring now even I love Zero dawn (sorry Horizon fan).

For the sheer scope of the game, i am not surprised that there were minor issues at launch. But as of the current patch, this should have been addressed.

First thing, I don't think the game deserves a 10 because of poor optimization on pc, second, why do I gave it a 9? I've never played a souls type game, Elden Ring was my first experience with a From Software game, and now at 96 hours and planning in getting it up, I'm going to play all Dark souls, and Sekiro, these games are just art, pure art .
At first you seem to have nowhere to go, no map, no hud indication, that's when you know what the devs want you to do, go explore, seek what you have to do in this enormous game, the gameplay is just better compared to the previous games, they took it almost to perfection, the progression of your character throughout the entire game, wich is massive, is so cool to be a part of, it gives you a feeling of achievement, joy.
And as usual, builds, there has to be in a From software game, this game gives you tons of items to do experiments, and in the PvE, every build if made correctly, gives feedback to the player, you see what you have experimented with, and become proud, you used what the game wanted you to, for something better...
Hope to have helped someone with this review, i wrote some things that i liked about this game, i say you should try it, everyone can beat this game, and that's other good aspect, but for now thats what i have to say, bye!",0,1
"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"I've created a metacritic account just to write a review for this game.

Let me start off by saying Elden Ring is the best game i've played since the Witcher 3, and besides that, is the most visually stunning game or media i've ever seen.

My specs are the following: i7-8700K, 16gb G.Skill DDR4 3200, GTX 1080, m.2 evo 970 1gb

I'm playing on max settings, 1440p, HDR on.
The game runs fine, mostly 60fps with dips into the low 40's. It could be further optimized, but the game itself is so unbelievably good that you tend to forget all about the performance issues by the 1st hour of gameplay.

Starting off, the game can be a bit disorienting. The map is gigantic, and besides a very general pointer guiding you in a specific direction, it can be a bit overwhelming.
As you start exploring, very quickly you realize that the map is not just big for the sake of being big. Every single nook and cranny of the map has some adventure awaiting the player. From dungeons, to optional bosses, to powerful loot, incredible lore.

About the lore, just WOW.
Every From game (besides Ninja Blade) has spectacular lore, and it's what keeps bringing the fans back. This game's lore, because the game has the capacity to carry it, is extremely deep and varied. Every single item, structure, enemy or even clutter, is there for a reason. To tell an incredible and epic tale the likes of which you could never find anywhere else.

The game doesn't hold your hand, and doesn't directly inform you of the details. Instead, it gives you the broad strokes, and trusts you to seek the truth behind this mysterious and dark world you've been cast into. No other game gave me a feeling like it trusts me to explore it, without guiding me to see everything it has to offer. No other developer is confident enough in its own creations to basically hide 75% of its content from the player, and trust the player to discover it by himself.

Entire areas, loot and bosses are practically hidden until you fulfill a very specific set of instructions to reveal them, and every time you do make that effort, you're rewarded with another piece of the epic puzzle that is Elden Ring and the Lands Between.

The combat is an amalgamation of everything that works in a soulslike game. From the posture breaking in Sekiro, to the fast pace of Bloodborne and the familiarity of Dark Souls, this is From combat perfected.

All in all, i didn't expect much from Elden Ring. I expected From to crash and burn on their first open world game, and i wasn't too sure the Dark Souls formula could translate to open world. But it did. And it did it better than any game released for the past 10 years. Bravo From software, and thank you for this incredible piece of art",0,1
"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"I feel that the reason there are so many negative reviews (aside form the review bombing which is just pathetic) Is due in large part to the difficulty of this game and this being peoples first time playing a  game like this with people first starting the game getting absolutely destroyed by the first boss and thinking the entire game will be like this.

Let me just say YOU CAN BEAT THIS GAME this series has gotten this reputation as being these unbeatable monoliths only made for the most hard core elite gamers and I have to say  That reputation is **** these games are hard I won't deny that but the game has ways of making it  easier.
This game has so many ways of making it easier on the player in fights whether that be through spirt summons, player summons, items in the world that weaken certain boss or just finding better weapons and armor.  I can't force you to love this game I can only ask you to give it a try because I do believe this is the peak of fromsoft games.

"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"Ну что могу сказать игра хороша, по любому она будет в моем сердечке, эти боссы эти локации этот открытый мир хоть все же мир не 1010 но на 710 точно будет.
БОССЫ:
Это моя любовь они лучшие из всех что были у From (я про сюжетных) какие же они колоритные и после 3 босса сложные: Радан сколько траев я на него потратил а Рикард уф. Жаль не могу сказать про боссов в открытом мире (Всадники, Стражи Древа, Драконы и тд.) они повторяются по 10 раз а то и больше.
Оружие и Броня:
Оружие это просто прорыв когда ты видишь очередное оружие у босса у тебя еще одна мотивация, ты так и хочешь его получить, каждое обладает своими способностями и супер атаками сражаться приятно.
Магия очень красивая и на начальных стадиях очень эффективная но все же дальше ей невозможно сражаться ибо боссы быстрые а магия менее эффективна я играл за рыцаря-мага и мне нравилось играть на расстоянии это было весело пока я не дошел до Ренналы а именно 2 стадии я охYел ибо хп у меня мало а маг против очень мощного мага это суицид.
Пепел войны мне идея понравилась а реализация еще больше куча всего я по факту проходил финальных боссов на пепле а именно морозный топор вещь.
Призыв духов много вариаций но топ для меня эта: слеза, кристалийца. Хотели игру упростить добавили духов пепел и тд но по ходу прохождения это не как выбор а как необходимость ибо босы дальше больнее.
Талисманы круто есть имба но она доступна под конец игры поэтому норм.
Броня, очень много разнообразия, также броню можно облегчать или утяжелять по мере необходимости но и характеристики брони будут менятся.
Кравт:
Как по мне бесполезная вещь я после 2 сюжетных боссов а это где то 12 часов игры заметил что он есть и как по мне он не нужен ну просто как доп механика.
Открытый мир:
По началу не зашло ибо меня задолбали открытые миры, я буквально за 20 дней до релиза Элден ринг начал проходить Дарк соус 3 и меня прям затянуло каждая локация важна ты не видишь халтуры ты 30 часов бегаешь по лабиринту и кайфуешь.
Открытый мир в Элде ринг это мир геншин импакт сам себя развлекай ищи пещеры данжи Боссы опять же не очень, но через часиков так 30 ты проникаешься этим миром. ну еще есть конь Торрент за это лайк. Города в эден ринг это красота каждый город и локация уникальна будь то Хогвартс или столица или замок в вулкане просто наслаждение.

This is like calling Quake 2 fresh because you have an inventory like in Hexen. There's no reason anyone should care.

"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,6,"This is one of the glitchier games i've played in a while, worse than my experience with Cyberpunk, Halo Infinite or the newer Call of Duty games. It's not enough to make it unplayable by any means, but random graphic glitches, enemies sometimes being invisible at first, stuttery visuals when moving.

I'm using an RTX 3080 graphics card too and only on High settings because on Maximum settings its much more stuttery. I shouldn't have any issues with one of the best modern graphics cards on the market, especially when this game isn't pushing the envelope on graphics. Running Cyberpunk on Ultra with RTX is a smoother experience than Elden Ring on High settings. I can't imagine how rough it is for people with mediocre specs. PC feels very much like an after thought. Weird controls by default, weird feeling mouse movement, doesn't auto-detect keyboard so you have to dig for the setting to change the button prompts.

Early into the game so hard to judge the quality of the game itself. The world feels fleshed out with solid lore and mechanics. You can tell they put a lot of passion into it within 10 minutes of playing. It's addicting and the downsides of the PC release don't ruin that, but it definitely burns a little bit.

I like:
Graphics are great, the monsters, the world - it all looks amazing.
Lore - the story and atmosphere is appealing.

I don't like:
Its very difficult and you cant change the difficulty setting anywhere (I know some people will defend that, but to me this is either willfully to discourage casual players from playing the game or just lazy cause it takes more time and energy to change how hard the game should be).

The combat is clunky (probably subjective), I defiently did'nt like that there is no type of lock-on system. So you feel like you are aiming right at your target but then instead you end up taking a swing right next to the enemy. The whole combat system feels clunky, other similiar games have done it way better.

Its got some serious performance issues on PC. As it stands now, its not really playable. This might be something they fix later on.

The game does'nt have a pause button - even though its a singleplayer experience. The stupidity here just blows my mind.

The game seems quite repetetive and like it has'nt really evolved much from its predecessor.

All in all, I feel like I gave this game a fair shake but ultimately its just to hard and frustrating to be fun. It dose'nt help that the combat system is poor as well. If these things were fixed as well as the performance issues, it might be a more enjoyable experience.

En ese aspecto Zelda Breth of the Wild se siente más completo.Aunque es interesante explorar, a veces me da mucha flojera intentar llegar a algún lugar, no creo que sea un juego para todos, si tienes poco tiempo para jugar, te sentirás abrumado por su mundo tan grande.Lo único que se me hizo extraño es que no pudieras jugarlo a más de 60fps, cuando la mayoría de los AAA ya cuentan con esa característica para pc, otro problema fue el control que no era detectado por el juego aunque me parece que ya se corrigió, al menos no he sentido que tuviera muchos errores en la jugabilidad como me pasó con Horizon forbidden west, que sigo con problemas en el juego a pesar de que lo tengo actualizado a la versión 1.06, ya mejor deje de jugarlo para esperar a que arreglen sus tonterías.",0,0

That is Elden Ring. It's the Skyrim of Souls Games. Whatever you see in the distance, you can go there. No invisible walls. Total Freedom.

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,7,"While I am not a stranger to difficult games, I've never took a dive into the souls-like genre. Elden Ring has therefore been my first proper look at this style of game, straight from the developers that made the genre flourish. Now, with 24 hours of play time, I'm ready to lay down some thoughts and provide a rating, though this could potentially change later if my feelings change.

Open World almost feels like a dirty word these days, and many people struggle to find big open maps engaging. I feel that Elden Ring really experiences both highs and lows from the open world it adopted; it can lead to some incredible moments at times, but can equally leave the game feeling like it lacks compelling content at other times.

Combat in Elden Ring is generally fun, with a good range of options to approach a battle from, although sometimes you might press a button and have to wait a while before your character decides to act on it which can lead to you getting hit. Bosses in the game are mostly good fights, with many of them teaching you important skills or lessons for later in the game, although a couple of bosses feel like they were not very well thought out. The music... well I don't remember any of it sadly, though when it is used it feels like it fits a situation well.

Many people have complained about the optimisation on PC. I'm not sure why - my PC isn't the best, and some parts I'm using are the bare minimum for the game to run, but I've only suffered minor dips to framerate which doesn't bother me at all.

My whole experience with Elden Ring has been overall positive, but full of problems big and small. I've only encountered one bug where I got stuck while on the horse and died 20 seconds later. Regardless, I think it's difficult to say if I would recommend the game. If you're interested in the genre, give it a shot. If you aren't then it's most likely best to steer clear.",0,0
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,7,"Almost just what I expected. Instead of making something like Bloodborne 2, a sequel to a game that many faithful players would be grateful for, the game developer suggested that their special ideas are much more interesting.
I skipped Sekiro because of boring ‘samurai’ setting and no freedom of character choice and was impatiently waiting for another souls-like. Here it is, I play the Elden Ring finally. And my feeling is so mixed. On one hand, I see a big and beautiful open world to explore. On the other, nothing could save me from feeling that the big and beautiful world of Elden Ring is empty and boring, despite the fact that some enemies and bosses are really tough to deal with. Some locations are really fascinating and entering one of these can be breathtaking, but this illusion breaks when you meet another portion of enemies which are a total disapointment compared to the surrounding landscapes. You would just wish to pass them as fast as you can to see something else, something really intriguing, but mostly you find none but disappointments. For example, you make tremendously difficult jumps to enter a huge lonely standing tower to find out that it contains a couple of mobs, a lot of deadly traps, another sequence of jumps, a boring boss which is however difficult just due to millions of HP, and another artifact which you would never use in further gameplay because of its uselessness. You do not find any shortcuts to other locations from there, just dead ends.  When you visit two or three such locations you just think - I would never visit this place if I play again. And in fact, most of these places don’t worth revisiting in case of further replays. Therefore, the need of the open world in this game is doubtful.
I didnt yet try to play caster characters, however sword or axe movesets are not that diverse as it was in DS or Bloodborne, and there is not much difference in using this or that weapon, each fight outcome just depends on your level or skill, thats all... it is not much fun anymore. There is some war ashes option available, however it requires FP, so it is not a variant if you like facerolling because then you would need maximum number of health potions. Sometimes stealth mode or spirits you can call for support deliver some fun, but there are still no chances of stealth bow/crossbow oneshot which makes this weapon just as useless as it was in previous souls games.
As of now I played over 70 hrs and yet did not finish the game, so it could potentially surprise me with something, but I doubt it so much. I think to pause for a while because I am really bored. However, I was expecting it, so it is not a complaint. These days all games are incredibly bad, and this game tries its best to be better, even if it fails",0,0

Don't get me wrong, it's really cool, but it dragged for too long, and it's not like you would go farm somewhere then come back stronger at the literal end of the game, natural instinct is to keep pushing, it's the final afterall.",0,0

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,5,"I don't want to be too harsh and give it a 0 - As the majority of the 'game' itself is great. The scenery is good (or what we can see of it at 16:9....). I enjoy that its difficult, I enjoy the world is huge and can be explored. Gameplay wise I do think they could have done a FAR better job with a tutorial. Instead of just a golden beam which leads you to an unkillable enemy then fend for yourself - Maybe the first few destinations should have been some of the key items and easy dungeons to settle people in. An in game journal would be a great benefit too.

But gameplay aside there are the horrific negatives

- No ultrawide support (or apparently.. its IN game, and you render at it, but artificial black bars cover it?) I cant for the life of me understand why they would do this. Open world games with scenery like this are the exact reason ultrawide exists!! if its some kind of 'fair play' between console and Pc gamers then its ridiculous. League of legends, one of the biggest most competitive games going allows Ultrawide, and that legit gives you an edge in that game.

- No NVIDIA DLSS. A game with such wide open spaces and alot to render would benefit SO MUCH from DLSS. It literally doubles or triples peoples performance with no visible negatives.

- FPS cap at 60 - So so poor. Console gamers find this bad framerate acceptable. PC Gamers do not. If its not 120+ It just feels clunky and broken.

- No Native PS controller icons in game when using it (just shows Xbox). How can they even get this wrong when the game LITERALLY is released for PS4/5 aswell AND theyre the biggest sales by FAR over Xbox.

-No FOV options. Game feels too close to character (ESPECIALLY WITH NO ULTRAWIDE!!!!)

For now im using the mod (that took less than 24 hours to release btw!!!) to get ultrawide and FPS cap remove. Which means cant play online - which sucks because I enjoy the message, blood patches etc.

Lets hope From Games take this info on board - since there are THOUSANDS of players wanting it. Its no good releasing a patch to fix these things months down the line when everyone has finished the game. I dont want to play through twice. I want to enjoy and play it NOW",0,0

Aside from the graphics optimization issues, overall Elden Ring is a great game.
They have improved on most of the shortcomings of the DS3 gameplay - mixing and adding new mechanics from Combat, movement, skills... in a balanced way. It must be said that the combat mechanism becomes much more comfortable than the DS3. And there are many ways to defend, dodge... and more fighting styles for you to choose and mix.
Keep the old ones and add new ones. Make it so much more complete.

Everything inside seems more comfortable. But the design of Boss and enemies of Elden Ring is more ferocious, more agile, more explosive combos. It doesn't make it any less challenging. you can hardly use the same way with all the Bosses in Elden Ring. Fast, Strong, Defense, Massive, Swarm,... you'll have to figure out how to deal with each of them, dodging every hit, keeping your composure and making your way through the barrage of attacks. Just make one mistake and you will get the consequences.

Dungeons are everywhere, they always give you great loot. But the dungeon boss was slowly rising. But the traps and puzzles will take you hours to get through. And you will die a lot.

Story:
A great story to discover, it's hidden behind everything. stories in Item, in ruins, in chance encounters with interesting NPCs. You will love some of them, some will make you laugh and some make you sad. Multiple endings depending on the progress and NPC you went through in their quest. You will find that your decisions have a certain effect on the world in Elden Ring. Both good and bad.

A main story with many branches and leaves. You won't feel complete if you just run away and beat the last boss. Because the secrets you come across along the way will also contribute to your perspective on the overall story. And don't skip any conversations. talk to the NPCs until the end of the dialogue and there are things that surprise you.

Art:
The Elden Ring's overall art may not be something everyone likes. If you like rainbows and dynamic, cheerful, modern colors. Then perhaps Elden Ring is quite outdated for you.
Elden Ring has an ancient, mysterious art style and a great overall tone. you won't feel it's lame. It is in harmony. They have balanced aesthetics into a large world. Makes you feel like a part of it. The landscape is filled with a multitude of things, the ecology changes from region to region, the weather and light pervades everywhere. Dark caves and majestic castles were everywhere, beneath the shining Erdtree's shadow. It is hard to find this feeling in other open world games.",0,0

They don’t realize that the difficulty of these games comes from THEM being a **** player because they were seasoned with the titles stated above, titles that reward you for being a **** player. They are not used to challenges. They want quest markers, dungeon markers, npc markers on the map. They want a difficulty setting. They don’t get what “roleplaying” means in these games. You’re not playing as some killing machine that can crush every single enemy as if they were tin cans, you’re playing as a person who seeks to be that strong one day, and you DO become that strong come late game. I hate that this game became a mountain of hype. Sorry but, the souls series doesn’t deserve this treatment. I don’t know why they decided to open it up to the general, more stupid audience.

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"With currently 33hrs on record I feel that the only thing I can say I am missing at this time is finishing the game that still feels a ways away.
Overall it is understandable to me for the launch to have had a few optimization issues but as those are being resolved I would find it ill to hold issues that are minor for most users against the game's score.
This is an amazing game that is worth your time if you are willing to put in the time required to learn the game system. New or old players can both rejoice and learn the big two lessons that Elden Ring has taught better than ever before within the first few minutes or hours depending on how quick you get to the first real boss or fight the first mini boss. 1- You can always return to something later with better gear and stats to make it more forgiving. 2- Eventually ramming your head against the wall will break it as long as you remember to learn from each mistake that lead to your death.
The open world never feels empty with even some of the more dead end areas at minimum having crafting materials.
Dungeons and bosses continue the classic formula and then go beyond showing more innovation than before, with varied environments and challenges as well as move sets and style.
I will close on mentioning that the way some bosses move in the game are leagues ahead of where the games have been previously. It feels more than ever like the bosses have a reaction to what you as a player are doing rather than simply your distance away from them mixed with a die roll. See the first main boss where you will be forced to learn the game, similar in its lessons to another boss in the other Fromsoft game Sekiro that could be classified as a point where many players ""clicked"" as to how the game worked.
In the end, I do suggest the game. But I say that anyone buying it should understand that it will require a bit of patience. You will not walk in here and dominate the game without first learning how the game works. And even then, sometimes you just miss a dodge roll haha.

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,9,"I usually refrain from writing reviews, but upon witnessing an absurd amount of straight 1's and 0's here I felt obligated to. Many of these reviews make it fairly clear who's played more than say, 30 minutes or so. Elden Ring is many things, ""just another souls-like"" is far from one of them. The game bases its combat on the same fundamental system the developers have been fine tuning for years. No, it does not make any overly significant changes to the underlying formula of its combat. Why would it? Don't fix what isn't broken, rather improve upon it. And to that end, they have. They have yet again found ways to incorporate lessons and experiments from other games they've made into an experience not unfamiliar and yet more expansive than previous. For instance, more refined use of stealth as an approach to scenarios, or the new ash of war system replacing weapon arts, allowing for far greater options in what weapons you use and how. Also, in case you somehow missed it, you have a horse, which you can use in fights, including some boss encounters, should you so choose. You have personal, AI summons you can find throughout the world to aid you in combat, many with their own unique strengths and abilities. That is just the combat, which as I mentioned, I wouldn't describe as some fundamentally different system, just an evolution of one that already worked quite well. More pertinent to discussions of this game is what it DOES do very differently. The open world approach is not so unlike many other open worlds, but a major change of pace for a souls like. It adds a degree of freedom not seen in prior installments, with it being possible to spend countless hours exploring the vast open world without hardly fighting any major bosses. That freedom allows one to play the game at their own pace. If you want to try to rush straight through, many encounters will prove more challenging, but those skilled enough can certainly do so. If you want to explore all the game has to offer, you can. The open world is far from lacking in things to do, and exploring is a rewarding experience often providing the player with more powerful tools with which to face the ever greater challenges of the main journey. The bosses themselves actually feel fairly unique to previous games, and those that are feel like they have improved greatly. The world itself has very engrossing environments, ranging from scenic to downright revolting, never failing to set the tone of an area. Areas are designed to be complex environments which can be approached in a variety of directions. The game never forces you to do anything you don't want to, as demonstrated from the very first boss you encounter, which you can walk right around and come back to when you are better prepared. All that said, the game is not without its failings. Performance issues are notable, but not so unbearable as many reviews make it sound. The minimum spec is a 1060. I have a 1050ti and have found that while my enjoyment has been hindered somewhat by lag or lower graphical fidelity, the game remains incredibly fun and runs well enough even for someone with weaker than supposedly required to even run the game. The approach to weapon upgrades can feel somewhat annoying as with previous titles, where you may find yourself wanting to use cool new weapons you find along the way but have already invested the materials you found into something else. The ""dungeons"" scattered throughout alleviate this issue somewhat, providing consistent repeatable methods of obtaining these materials, but lets face it, nobody like having to go through something multiple times just for materials. It's a small time sink, but a time sink nonetheless and I'm not a grind gamer. The game itself isn't a graphical powerhouse (having seen it on a friend's pc, with a 3090) but the design of enemies, weapons, and environments are done well enough to be good looking regardless. The game itself is VERY long, something I both enjoy and have some disdain for, solely because the game has so much to offer I can't touch just yet because my build doesn't permit it.
Overall, the game is incredibly FUN. It doesn't look the best. It doesn't run the best. But it's one of the most purely fun titles to release in years. It has no shortage of content, with my first run through approaching 50 hours and being nowhere close to done. I have enjoyed every second of it, and If you're willing to look past some superficial flaws and give it an honest try, I'm sure you will too. Don't be intimated by difficulty. The game offers ample ways to grow in strength for encounters and has a healthy playerbase more than willing to help you overcome challenges. I'd rate it an 8.5 if I could, a 9 seems to overlook more of the flaws than I would like but an 8 feels as though it undersells just how enjoyable the journey really is.
A great game to start with for potential new players to the series due to its open nature, more than worth its price tag.",0,0
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"This game is great. The dark souls formula intertwined with a open-world dynamic is the best gaming experience I have ever had.

Blows my mind people have issues on better hardware than I have.

If this is your first FromSoftware game, I will say its hard to recommend. There games are not like any other game. Think about it, I'd recommend a friend, who never play a FromSoftware game, to try Dark Souls 3 first.

"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,pc,10,"Let me start by saying that I only recently started playing games by From Software, starting first with Sekiro, then Dark Souls 3, started playing Dark Souls Remastered, but quickly hopped onto Elden Ring when it came out.

I believe the game whole heartedly deserves of an 8.7/10 mainly due to performance issues, but I am rating it a 10/10 because of the imbalance there is with the reviews I have been reading (skip to last two paragraphs for more detailed explanation of what I mean).

First let me address the overinflated, totally not an elephant elephant in the room, the performance issues. My computer can definitely hold its own: 1440p max settings with a  4 core xeon, 48 Gbs of ram , and a titan xp gpu. For me personally (your mileage may vary), I am having minimal to non-existant stuttering or framerate drop. Do stuttering and framerate drops occur? Yes. Was it significant enough that I couldn't enjoy the game? Hell no. Honestly, I can only attest to my own experience, but these performance issues occur so infrequently or not at all during my 1-2 hour play sessions that I forget its even issue people are actually complaining about. When stuttering does actually happen, it lasts no more than 2-3 seconds. I've put 30 hours into the game and look forward to my next 30 hours.

As for gameplay,  any comparison of Elden Ring to Far Cry is simply lazy and delusional. For the sake of comparison, I'd say this game is more on par with The Witcher 3. The crafting system is excellent, fighting is clean and smooth, leveling is a bit harder than souls 3, enemies are difficult and bosses are fun and challenging.

I will say my biggest, and so far only frustration with the game is the button mapping. It is limited and I'm stuck wondering why does R3 also serve as a torrent dismount? The amount of times I've accidentally dismounted at the most inconvenient times is frustrating, and there are limited options for remapping. I also will not play on a mouse and keyboard because I'm not a lunatic. I find leveling up much harder on this game than in other souls game, but this is more of something I need to adjust to rather than a frustration.

I have read many of the negative reviews and I completely understand why someone might not like a game due to the performance issues or lack of ultrawide support. Does that deem the game a 0/10. Absolutely not. Yet again, these are not professional reviewers  who know how to properly evaluate something. Reviews take into consideration a variety of aspects, of which none never account for 100% of the score. So while performance is no doubt a category to be considered in a games overall score. It would never account for perhaps more than 20% of the final score. I literally just read a review that said 'it's a great game, but can't recommend it in this state - 0/10'. Really? It seems to me that reviews are either '0/10 - stuttering, no ultrawide' and mention nothing of the actual game itself. Or they are '10/10 masterpiece and completely ignore the performance issues.

With that being said, I believe the game is minimum an 8.7/10. However, I'm scoring it a 10/10 because it deserves to be higher than what it currently is on Metacritic. All the 0/10 reviews simply complain about the lack of ultrawide support or performance and don't even talk about the game itself. From my personal experience, I had minimal stuttering and it had zero effect on my enjoyment of the game itself.  Honestly, the stuttering happens rarely during a typical sessions for me (1-2 hours). When it does happen, I hardly notice it and it's gone in a few seconds. I understand why negative reviewers are frustrated, but most are being lazy and cannot control their emotions.

- Exaggerated reuse of some bosses/enemies
- Flying enemies are extremely hard to hit
- Unclear quest triggers and the next place in which an NPC will appear is almost always totally unknown
- Multiple quests are tied to optional areas and dungeons, and they might be forever lost if dungeons are not made in a specific order or if you miss a dungeon and advance too much in the main story (which is stupid in an open world)

Miscellanous:
* There are some bugs, but they’re not many or severe for an open world
* Getting all the achievements/trophies might be tricky without a guide, since some quests or equipments might be lost if not obtained before a specific moment
* Based on howlongotobeat.com, most players play it for 50-60 hours, while a completionist run takes around 90-100 hours",0,0

Il motivo per cui ho dato un 9 al gioco è proprio per via delle poche comodità da PC Ho potuto addirittura provare l'emozione di perdere 10 ore di salvataggi, per motivi del tutto legati alla debole o quasi mancante ottimizzazione su questa piattaformaCi rendiamo conto? Mai spento il gioco bruscamente, mai toccato i file di gioco o manomesso le qualità grafiche pesantemente eppure steam ed il suo steam cloud sono riusciti a farmi perdere tutte quelle ore? In conclusione, questo gioco va comprato, e sono veramente deluso da questo punteggio basso che si mostra dai gamer amatoriali, molti criticano come me i problemi dal pc, ma molti altri la difficoltà...

I made an account just to counteract the terror attack that has befallen this masterpiece of a game. Shame on you people! The amount of work that was put into this game alone should be enough to earn praise, and all your negative reviews are doing is hurting the people who made it. These people are review bombing this game because of occasional stuttering, very occasional by the way, as I have 90+ hours already put into this game and just can't put it down! So people are angry about a bit of stuttering, that's no reason to give it a 0 rating, none of you are actually taking the game itself into account. I seem to remember another game that had performance issues due to its massive size, however it retained its positive rating and is hailed as one of the greatest games of all time. If course, I'm speaking of skyrim. To the people who want actual reviews, please use your brains and read some reviews, you'll see that it's really a great game, even made inviting to non souls-like players. No it does not have ultra wide support, but does it deserve to die based on that? Come on people, think a little. Also someone mentioned bad controller support, but none of the people I play with nor myself have had any issues with this, so I don't know where that's coming from.

FFS reviews should be about the game as it is not potential improvements. Don't you realize this is the same thing EA did with anthem and CDPR with Cyberpunk????? I love From Software. I've been playing elden ring for 12 hour streaks on my days off, sometimes even more. But you CANNOT just casually say ""the only blemish in an otherwise stellar game"" about performance. You have no idea how flipping annoying and immersion breaking this game is when it trips over fps. I have adhd and I can hyper concentrate on details like that, and although I love the game, it makes me so mad at Miyazaki every time I mount my horse and my fps goes from a solid 60 to 33. On a ryzen 9 and 2060 setup on 1080. I can run games like this on 2 monitors with max settings and get over 60 steady. There is absolutely no reason why FromSoft can keep doing this to the PC community. Dark Souls remastered was next to unplayable for me. Sorry for the rant, but crap like ""Once it gets fixed it'll be all right you'll see!"" does not help. I expect this problem not to even be here in the first place. You're pissing in my face and telling me it'll be all right once I'm done!

More observations:
- If you manage to kill an enemy it respawns after you rested.
- It is not possible to save with e.g. F5 so saving after a win is not an option.
- There are no levels. So you can not turn the game to easy mode to at least see a little bit of the world you paid sixty (!) euros for.
- You are tempted to play just long enough for Steam to refuse a refund.

"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,7,"First I would like to start by saying that giving this game a ten is not serious and giving it a 0 just because you are pissed at it is childish.
I have always been a very big fan of the Soulborne serie, I finished every one of them multiple times these are awesome games.
Elden Ring is a good game but its not great, for me its kind of a deception.
Dont get me wrong the gameplay mechanic is good, the graphic are fine, some environments are beautifull to watch  and I like the idea of an open world soul games, I always wanted that.

One major problem is, its not rewarding, the ennemies are not giving anything worth the time it take to kill them including the boss, its grindy to a point that it is boring just to level up once.
That make the random coop to help peoples killing their boss almost useless.
Many hard and massives ennemies are giving around 50 runes (souls) even if they take 5 minutes to kill, when you need aroung 10 000 runes to lvl up its dumb.
Thats why so many peoples are relaying on a stupid runes run like the boulder that drop around 2000 runes when you let it fall of the cliff, what a joke...

Is it me or almost every big monsters, mini boss and main boss have now a sniper attack and an aoe that smash the ground creating a blast of wind destroying everything around them for a 15 feets radius, so many boss are difficult just because of that, its cheap and lame.
There is a lot of giants in the first part of the map and they all do the ""Dovahkiin"" scream attack that can hurt you and make you fall from your horse even if you are 500 feets away from them.
Many monsters seem to have unlimited stamina and will lend an never ending serie of hits on your face and many of them seem to move like a ninja even if they are obese.

That bring me to the horse, since nothing is worth killing I found myself just running aroung with the horse avoiding the monsters who are not worth my time just to collect items and find dungeons, this make the concept of open world pretty boring to me.

Next the coop, that is my biggest deception in the game, its like the old system, you summon somebody in a restricted zone, kill the boss then they are kicked out of your game.
Me and my friends were mad when we found out that there was a massive fog gate stopping us from getting acces to an entire island just because I killed the boss at the end of the castle, this is pathetic, no evolution whatsoever even for a so call open world.
When you take a look at some great coop game like (Remnant from the Ashes) where you can coop with the same two peoples from start to finish without interruption, getting refreshing health, potions and ammunitions at the checkpoint togetter there is no excuse to give us the same old crappy coop system like in Demon Soul on the ps3.
This is lazy and weak.

And the checkpoints make no sense at all, sometime you will find two checkpoints close to each other with nothing dangerous between them and sometime you will face hordes of dangerous and aggressives beast hoping to find the next checkpoint 10 miles further.

In conclusion Elden Ring is not bad but its not great, it could have been one of the best game ever but there is too many flaws and stupids concept to make it what it should be.
For me its a 7 that could have been a solid 9, sadly its not.",4,4
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,5,"The first 25 hours of this game are the absolute peak of video-game. A cool gameplay, a new and diverse world to explore, new enemies, cool spells and weapons, cool side-bosses and stuff, nice cinematics and all.
Then, you continue playing and starts to realize that the game is so unbalanced that hurts. Enemies with too many health, exhausting and loooong combos that kill you with 2-3 moves and a very aggressive behavior, that dont give you a chance to initiate a combo. Really, many enemies in this game have 10000 of poise, and they simply dont feel your hits, then proceed to obliterate you with 2-3 hits, even if you have 43-50 in vitality, alongside the fact that seems that every enemy in this game has some magic ou spell in their moveset, making them almost perfect in combat. All enemies and bosses uses the same strategy, they trick you by fake or prolonging moves that would look very fast and some of them are really fast that you have like 0.3 second to evade or take a literal combo of 30 moves that f*cking kill you.
The world exploration is literally not worthy, you might find some SUPER OP secondary bosses that would give you not enough runes and a useless item. Plus, they are almost the same and the dungeons are almost the same as well, super boring.
FromSoftware tried to create a ""easy mode"" by letting you catch ""Pokemon Souls"" and throw them to help you at combat and improve the usage of magic in the early-game, then they ruined the STR and DEX players that wont really care or would use this type of mechanic.
This game really needs a balancing or the majority of the players are not gonna enjoy it. I'v played DS1, DS2 and Bloodborne, they are hard, not unfair as this game is.
Miyazaki proved that he CANNOT create a open-world game and Dark Souls shouldnt be a open-world game. In all games the world is dead and empty of good people but full of boring enemies. Try again later, because this game was a failure.",2,2

And if a Fromsoft game ever needed 'Patches' (sorry) it's this one haha This game should be rated higher but due to the serious technical issues on all systems it has to be a red score...for now.  Let me explain.Im a huge fromsoft fan and trust only them for day 1 preorders. I've platinumed all their games.  Buy It really worries me that blupoint demon souls remaster can launch at 4k 60fps or near to it but elden ring can barely hit 30fps and often dips as low as 15 in sadly the areas where you need consistent performance.  Ironically on ps4pro on a ps5 it runs at a solid 60fps but at luke 1800 using checkerboard and looks good.  On ps4pro it's not so good sadly.  I bought a ps5 for improved graphics but all I get is decade old issues which on pc ive left behind with a 3080 though I've Elden ring runs worse on a 3080 than on a ps5 lol  So you can imagine the ps4 version is alot worse without that sad drive.There is a whiff of cyberpunk about the game where fans are blindly supporting and conveniently ignoring the serious technical issues which also include a few progression stopping glitches / bugs and the occasional game breaking issue.And post launch the patches are not addressing these issues. It still looks and runs like a...ps3 gen era game but tlou was ps3 and that ran and looked far better so...elden ring just looks ugly.  Great art design but everything else is far from the beauty of sekiro or the grandeur of bloodborne.The open world simply fails in 2022. If it was 2010 then I'm sure it be far more impressive as it has 2010 graphics. It's not remotely as good as botw or rdr2 which are games that existed before ER development even started. The latter alone is worrying  but the large empty space which witcher 3 dlc would laugh at...isnt much fun to play. Yes You can explore but you'll only find Skyrim like identical copy and paste areas. Forget the wildlife of most open world games or npcs with compelling stories.The George Martin element is inexplicably non existent making the game effectively a dark souls 4. The latter isn't a bad thing but it's not as good as ds3 in visuals / performance or gameplay so where does this leave us?The game isn't suitable for noobs or non fromsoft fans. It's a game seemingly more for fan boys, prepaid journalists and shills to scream ""goty!"" while they wait for gameplay saving 'Patches' (sorry ;). It's not a bad game by any means but it has bad aspects to it or lazy maybe.  Bloodborne launched in a rough state so this is nothing new but it's still not acceptable.Wait for a sale a year from now when it's been fully patched.  Eventually maybe 7-8 /10 but a 4/10 !t launch due to poor technical state :(",5,6
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,5,"This game is average but IMO the worst FromSoft game I played. I can't understand people giving this buggy, unfinished and unfair mess a perfect 10/10 and we shouldn't give FS slack for lacking polish in their game, time and time again, as compared to other studios.
This game is the definition of quantity over quality. FS games have always been about the right mix of challenge and frustration in encounters. The bosses in this game are horrible with hyper aggression (all of them), tons of damage, AOE spams and 1 hit combos with (mostly) no telegraphing. In addition, areas are so badly balanced that one moment you slay enemies left right and center with no problem and the next - in the same area - get gutted by one type like you never played before.

In short: The game has technical flaws (e.g., bad performance), feels dated, inconsistent and imbalanced difficulty (e.g.,  death combos and a lot of trial and error encounters) and enemy design (e.g., rehash's), some very bland and uninspiring environments which lack in atmosphere, frustrating gameplay mechanics (e.g., no omni-roll which players have asked for since DS1), a lackluster story (which must be put together by the players themselves) and bad boss lineup (i.e., very inconsistent and often bigger versions of normal enemies). Overall, I would say this game leans more towards frustration than meaningful challenge and fixing some of the above mentioned would probably make it better.

For me personally, I miss more confined and scripted levels which are more atmospheric but where encounters feel ""designed"". However, what does it for me is that this game has the worst overall quality for bosses (a lot more mind you and there are good ones but quality over quantity), some poor enemy designs and the overall (lack of) balance for various encounters.",4,5

If you like an egregiously unbalanced and unfair endgame then you'll love Elden Ring. If you like encountering bosses that the developers didn't bother balancing for your play style on a regular basis throughout the game, then why are you reading this review and not playing Elden Ring? The massive, empty open world completely destroys any prospect of replay ability for people that have lives and responsibilities.

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,3,"I've played all the FromSoftware titles and in all honesty, this title ranks bottom with Dark souls 2.

It could have been a potentially awesome game but it was marred by lack of optimization. I can totally understand if this title was for current gen consoles only (xbox series x/ ps5) nd PC but to release this game on last gen consoles in this state leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

This title was not optimized properly for release, that even the day1 barely does anything to address it. Yes! This is nothing new to anyone familiar with buying from FromSoftware on day 1, but when are they going to start becoming better, it very disappointing.

Dare I say, Dark souls 1,2,3 run better than this game. Yes! This has more content but that is just an excuse. I have a brand new PS4 console launching it with Elden ring, and the performance is appalling. Frame rate issues every now and then, not to exclude enemies clipping out. Literally any location with a vast number of multiple enemies would drop the frame rate. Heck, I can't even challenge the dragons properly.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,9,"If you haven't played a Dark Souls game before - there's a steep learning curve ahead. As a seasoned DS veteran even I had a rough time starting this game. But for those newcomers, those who give up early and those who ""don't get it"" - you need to understand that it's your second attempt where things really kick off. Typically in a souls game you get crushed, you lose your souls, you invest in the wrong stats, but on your second attempt when you ""get it"", and you whack your souls in to your favourite weapon of choice you will breeze through what was previously difficult - and that's the hook to these games.

For Dark Souls fans like myself - it's an odd start. It's unusual to have the wide open world, however everything else plays very much like Dark Souls. As soon as I found my first cave, learned how to summon and whacked a few points in Dex - I was hooked. You can open your map - find something that looks odd, whack a beacon there and travel. You will gladly get distracted by interests and oddities along the way - and every little settlement, cave and outpost feels meaningful, with great rewards.

You have to trust in From. They have your user experience at heart. You have to know that these guys excel at hiding away incredible locations, quests and items for you to discover, and you're just not going to see any of that with 10 hours of gameplay. People are too quick to pick up a controller and give up nowadays. In the 90's when you had one game a year, you'd explore every inch. And that's how you play this game. It's a marathon not a sprint!

Ultimately - it looks, plays and feels like Dark Souls in an open world, with lots of smaller interesting dungeons and bigger set pieces. No - the graphics aren't incredible, but the atmosphere is there. The souls series has never set out to be a graphical masterpiece - and I'd rather they keep doing what they are doing, producing compelling, stellar games - than bust out one boring yet graphically impression EA / Ubisoft title per year.

You might be daunted by the big open world, whether you're a dark souls fan or not. I know I was - but trust the process and let it sink it's teeth in to you - and you'll be coming back to drop a 9 in these reviews.",3,5
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,6,"This game is getting raving reviews from journalists, simply because FromSoft is trendy, and you gotta at least pretend to love them to be in.
Sadly, the truth is that the game is the weakest of the Souls lot. The open world aspect is PS3 era, and so are the game mechanics. And while Fromsoft's visual style was brill back when Bloodborne launched, its all just rather dreary and dismal today.
As a game its playable, like all souls games, after bit of practice. But like with earlier FromSoft games, it suffers from lack of story and lack of direction and meaningful goals. You just try to get your hero stronger to beat the next boss around, just like you did in previous games, and that is all. Way too basic to last. And as far as cinematics go, they're all pretty clumsy when compared to the utterly brill cinematics of Ghost of Tsushima.
Would I recommend this game to anyone? Well, I loved the older Souls games, and this one, frankly, lacks the magic of them. So no. Wait till it is on sale, as by then they will have, hopefully, polished it up a bit as well.",6,12

The open world is amazing and I could just walk or ride in a direction and I would find something new and cool. I like the starting class options a lot cooler than before with in my eyes more different option. People are still saying it´s not more accessible but it really is. You just have to take the lose and go a different direction or if its a fight in the open world run to it with your horse get your runes and run away and then go fight more enemies and level.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,10,"My introduction to the ‘Soulsbourne’ series was Dark Souls II, and my initial impression of the franchise was much the same as many of the negative reviews in this thread. After a steep learning curve in which, above all else, I learned to embrace failure, I discovered the real beauty of these games. Since then I’ve spent countless hours with each of the titles that preceded Elden ring and I can honestly say that it distills the best attributes of each of those games into something close to perfection.Elden Ring is perhaps the most accessible souls game to date. While it can be immensely challenging from the start, the ability to explore a richly populated open world means that it’s not as relentlessly oppressive as the drudgery of reaching an impasse in previous titles. The revised combat and play forming mechanics imbue this game with a fluidity that makes it a joy to navigate, and the art style, visual effects and sound design are beautifully cinematic.It wasn’t until I defeated the first major boss that I caught a glimpse of the immense scale of this gaming world. What’s more impressive is how organic and living the environments and encounters feel. I am truly awe struck by this sublime creation.Admittedly I didn’t partake in much of the hype leading up to its release, and more or less bought it on a whim (usually I’d wait a few months until the game comes down in price); however, buying this game at launch is truly a worthy investment as the sense of community and discovery experienced by partaking in such a cultural phenomenon is nothing short of exhilarating.

Slight technical hickups don't distract from that, it's completely playable and often times very beautiful even on base PS4. They have taken the best elements from Demon's and Dark Souls game and combined them with an open world design very much in the spirit of that gameplay. Does not hold your hand, gives immense freedom in character builds, you can try to cheese enemies, you can grind, you can go anywhere, making this one of the most overwhelming, but also most accessible souls experiences.The reward for uncoupling your brain from ""but muh grephics!

It’s almost impossible to actually find your way through things unless you played a dark souls game and know that things are just hiding against walls waiting to 1 shot you. The bosses are literally insane they can easily kill you faster than you can get one hit off with almost any weapon that isn’t small it’s just all in all a game that will make you hate it and will take much more time than it’s worth. So if you like games that give the bosses the cool move sets and the better weapons than by all means waste the 60 dollars and have fun either spending a full 30 min chipping away at a bosses health and practically just dodging the whole time or killing small enemy’s that roam to farm runes for weeks and weeks just to level up slightly (which makes almost no difference to anything except what u can use) so you can maybe kill your first boss and move on to the other 20+.,1,2

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,0,"I have never played any of the Souls games before, but being a connoisseur of RPGs and hearing of this supposedly legendary RPG series I felt it was time I finally bit the bullet. I figured with Martin penning the game's story it would be rather grand involving political intrigue and riveting tales of man's inner folly. Having grown up on D&amp;D and CRPGs I expected to have a fair idea of what I was getting into.

Much to my surprise, I found a vast open world filled with nothing to do. I created my character to wander around some lifeless void. Oh, it looks rather grand the art direction is quite phenomenal though the textures muddied and the game is plagued with pop-ins as well. I am able to forgive the occasional jank for a good and true RPG. I however did not find one in this game. I'm not sure what constitutes for an RPG these days amongst the general public, but generally it's a game with roleplaying options of which this game seems to have none other than building your character's stats and skills.

All problems are solved through this game's languid, ponderous, and clunky combat. No non-combat or social options in this supposed RPG. The exploration as as dull and lifeless as the world in which it inhabits. Some scant crafting materials to create some mediocre items with minimal stat gains. Undoubtedly the usual carrot and the stick seen in the MMO sphere influenced this trash itemization.

The dungeons were quite interesting and a more linear experience and I killed Margit after ten or twelve tries. The game's molasses combat was made even more frustrating due to the various technical issues that plague this supposed RPG (Hint it's not an RPG it's just combat pornography) Your character's hitboxes are far too large causing the enemies to strike you frequently when you're clearly outside of their swing radius. There's also numerous frame rate drops making the game's sole feature of combat extremely difficult since the technical execution of the developers lack of talent is holding you back further than the difficulty of the game is.

All in all this game is not an RPG, there are no roleplaying options. It's just combat pornography for the youth's violent masturbatory sadist rituals. If you have any class avoid this buggy mess like the plague it is and cast it into the fire! I for one got a full refund from my local gamestore, but I hope to save others the expense. We all know this game doesn't deserve a perfect score.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,0,"Buddy told me to check this game out I used to play some action games back on the PS2. Not really my jam these days, but I figured what they hell why not. Let me tell you this is no God of War. Booted this game up thought it looked okay, kind of like an old 360 game, but whatever. Must be a good story or something.

Speaking of story I guess other than the one eyed girl and the crappy cutscene there isn't really one. Figured since it had the Game of Thrones writer on it it may be cool, but I guess this is the reason why everyone hates the damned show now. He must not be very good, probably another SJW propped up by the hollywood elites.

Dodge mechanics are pretty clunky and don't seem to work quite right.. Seems like your character's hit box is larger than Nancy Pelosi's slush fund. Clipping seems to guarantee that the enemies kill you through walls and rocks and other crap, but you never seem to go through them. I presume it's some intentional feature to create a faux sense of challenge to the game. The alternative is that the programmers lack the technical wherewithal to pull of what they're striving for. Now that I think on that though it's probably the latter with the number of bugs this game has. Frame rate drops are pretty harsh and consistently occur on boss encounters.

Maybe it would have been a cool game if the story was any interesting or if the developers were worth a lick, but they seem to be reaching for the stars when they can't even grab the dirt off the floor very well. Play God of War any of them and hard if you wanna play a real good game.

Game tries too hard to make things difficult without any payoff. Even when you beat a boss or a large group of enemies you don't get anything that makes you feel like it was worth the hours you put in to defeat them. Games like WOW took hours, sometimes days to down a boss in a raid but there was always some juicy gear that dropped and had to be rolled on. You don't get that with this game at all. I cleared an entire camp that took me around 3 hours of stealth killing, running away, trying different tactics only to get something that my class of character can't even use. I killed a mob of 5 wolves and got a few bones from two of the wolves that I used to make one arrow out of. What's the point of putting a bow an arrow in the game if you never have arrows or have to grind 10 hours to get a quiver. Just senseless difficulty. Just a genuine torture to play. Game has no true content it just bogs the player down with senseless grinding.

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,4,"So, this game is not as perfect as it sounds. Speaking with """""" just"""""" 20 hours. The main problem is that the combat is ripped mostly off of ds3, which was already copying some stuff from previous souls. Most of your weapons have old attacks, most ashes you find have the weapon arts that you can just swap around and bleed is ds1's but even more broken since weapons don't deal as much damage as they did in that game. Them you add on top of that a vombat that doesn't really reward you since the prize for beating off base enemies is waaay too little, so souls dropped and loot given, but the damage and risk is pretty high. The map is good but pretty bland, not containing really anything astonishing if not for the trees themselves. The open world aspect got butched since the enemies follow the ds3 formula ""more damage means difficult"" and so you don't really understand whete you are meant to go. Bosses are extremely underwhelming, not even in ds2 you can just walk back and spam magic to absolutely destroy one of the first major bossfights of the game. As a mage, is really annoying having to separate your estus flasks in health and magic, a sistem that didn't shine in ds3 but here is worse because you could craft AP restoring potions and stuff. The AI is just as bad as ds3's. Enemies with bows either have infinite range and impossible tracking or a very short range for reasons. The crafting system is botched, being basically useless if not for arrows. The graces are in horrible position, every single one of them, never has been a worse spacing in a From Software game.  After 20 hours i still don't have a better spell than the basic missle. Clerics are wayyyy to pushed in this game. Leveling is too expensive. Windows look horrible, especially the tinted glass obes. Sone things lack a tutorial that would be much needed, like how to obtain new magic slots. Overall, the game lacks balance and feels boring and repetitive. I wouldn't give it a 4/10 but every 10/10 is just objectively wrong and needs to be fighted, but still it would be a 6/10.",1,3

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,1,Not playable after the patch today.There have been minor performance issues on the launch day but after a small update today there are missing frames. Maybe they turned on hardcore mode but how should you fight if the boss attacks you and it skips the attack frames. You are getting one hitted without being able to see what's happening or to react. Frame skipes and stuttering makes it unplayable .,3,10
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,0,WINDOWS 10 only? when Dark Souls 3 worked perfectly on Windows 7? Unacceptable.,4,14
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,0,"I’m sorry, but a game releasing in 2022 with PS3 level graphics that constantly fluctuates from 30 - 60 FPS (even in performance mode) is unacceptable. Furthermore, even if we disregard the frame rate issues, I’m not impressed with the gameplay at all. This has easily the clunkiest combat of any souls game so far; I find the movement is often unresponsive, and the hit boxes are horribly implemented. I’ll also add that if you weren’t a fan of Dark Souls, this game isn’t for you. It’s effectively Dark Souls 3, but this time it’s open world. Speaking of open world, let’s discuss that shall we? The map is pretty big, and gives you a lot of freedom and exploration possibilities, which is nice. However, there’s very little environmental variety, like at all. It’s all a very similar bleak landscape that never changes. This would be fine if the game was linear, but, for a game that encourages exploration so much, it kinda makes it feel repetitive. Perhaps a bigger issue, however, is that there simply isn’t a whole lot going on in the world. In many of the reviews for this game (particularly ign’s), they state that the game has a lot of variety in special events happening in the open world. However, I found that most of these “special” events are limited to being ambushed by enemy’s. That’s really the meat of exploring the map, is being ambushed by enemies. This is alleviated somewhat by the fact that the game has excellent enemy variety, from both a visual and mechanical standpoint. Though I don’t think that’s enough to save it from feeling repetitive (especially considering that many of the enemies are recycled from past FromSoftware games). Finally, I’ll talk about the traversal itself. The main positive here is that this is the first FromSoftware title to add a jump button, which is pretty necessary for this game. Beyond that though, it sort of goes downhill from there. There’s no climbing mechanic, no underwater exploration, no flying mechanics, etc. Are these things necessary to the game? No. But for as much as the reviews emphasized the “freedom of exploration” this game provides to you, it sort of rings hollow once you actually enter the game. So yeah, those are my thoughts as of right now. I know I am very much in the minority when I say this, but that’s how I feel. I would’ve given it a higher rating if it simply had a framerate lock option (even at 30fps!). But for me, personally, I have a hard time playing game with fluctuating framerates (especially to this degree)",4,14
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,0,"A big map doesn't make a better game. Uninteresting, bland and boring. Doesn't deserve any of it's perfect scores. Heck, doesn't deserve more than a 6 if you stretch it a lot. The controls are just as bad as the ""story"" and visuals. The character feels heavy and moves so slow. Feels clunky. Sound was also uninteresting. Nothing sticks to mind. So, a very below average game that was overhyped by possibly one of the most toxic fanbases there are. This kind of game needs to stop being produced.",2,7
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,4,"This pains me to say it but this game is easily the worst from software game I played to date. I was so hyped for this game after it's reveal and after playing dark souls 1 and 3, bloodborne, sekiro, and even deracine, I expected this game to be the best part of all them. But if anything, they just removed the best aspects of their previous games, from the beautiful levels that were handcrafted to near perfection, elden ring just doesn't have that. The open world of limgrave although stunning to look at first eventually devolves into bland empty grass fields with groups of brain dead ai scattered across. It's not even worth fighting them due to how little runes you get after clearing them. There's also dungeons that are about as pointless to explore due to how uninteresting it is to explore with the final boss at the end just being copy pasted from other areas, honestly i don't get what's so special about the open world at all, if anything it drastically ruins the flow of the game. There's also static npc's you could find stand around all day and night barely moving to just spout exposition at you while you're character just stands there when you talk them. The core combat is fine but it's just dark souls 3 again which after sekiro feels like a big step backwards. Overall spent around 15 hours in the game and absolutely dreading playing more, so I think I'll just call it quits and say this game isn't for me",2,7

Combat, is horribly unresponsive.  Enemies are cool to look at but a pain to kill.  Unfortunately you have to cheese much of the enemies.  Because they have unlimited stamina, so stupid.There’s one item in the game that wrecks everything especially bosses because it removes a huge chunk of %hp and it’s available early on in the game.  There’s a difference between not having stamina on your character which keeps you from acting, BUT it’s horrible when you have full stamina and your character decides not to role or attack… or you can’t change weapon.Bosses have huge hit boxes…  This game feels unfinished, like Anthem.  I’m really not sure what music the reviewers are talking about, it’s the same combat music throughout the game.  Repetitive…If you guys ever played dragons dogma, that’s basically the graphics.  It’s especially noticeable on cloth clothing.  R.R Martin really only gave suggestions, BTW not sure if they’ll get sued but a few of the enemies are from Game of Thrones… Example the tall soldiers with long white hair, frozen skin with ice javelins.Masterpiece… No… Decent maybe.  I’ve lost a lot of respect for many of these profesional reviewers.  It’s an okay game.  There’s a formula to masterpiece games and Zelda nailed it.  The map isn’t big, compared to other games.

Are you people serious? The rest of the game is an absolute triumph of art and design, as well as a culmination of most of the best mechanics from From Soft's game library, but you'll trash it for stuttering every once in a while? What a bunch of babies.

The problem with Cyberpunk 2077 at launch wasn't just that it had a bad framerate. The problem was that it would crash all the time, the AI was atrocious, entire features felt missing, and characters would just spawn in random locations sometimes. Elden Ring hasn't crashed for me once, the enemy AI are quite sophisticated, the game is packed to the brim with great content, and mechanically, everything seems really solid. And the performance hitches will probably be improved with patches over time.

Do these people not remember Blighttown? Would they also give the original Dark Souls a 0/10 because of its occasional hitches? Or Bloodborne, which is locked at 30 FPS for the entire game? Is that a 0/10? Or Skyrim, which still has tons of bugs TO THIS DAY? Definitely a 0/10.

None of these reviews are serious.

The game is not perfect, and I can absolutely understand docking a few points for performance hitches or language limitations if those things matter to you. Maybe a 7/10 or a 6/10, or heck, even a 3/10 if those things really, really matter to you. But a 0/10 for a game that is so clearly not garbage is not a useful review to anyone.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,10,"I'm a Fromsoft veteran. Dark Souls cured my chronic dissatisfaction with modern gaming way back in 2012. In 2022, they've done it again. There's only one drawback to falling in love with a game like Elden Ring: you'll never feel the same about other games again. This isn't just an updated, re-skinned, FIFA sequel. This is a quantum leap into open world gaming that has surpassed all other attempts by companies who are purveyors of the genre and gathering all the best elements of Fromsoft's previous creative efforts into a tour de force of gaming perfection. Somehow, Elden Ring has left all other open world games in the dust. That's quite impressive. But, what's more impressive is it's their first try. The visual style and ambience of the game strikes an ethereal tone, playing with tropes of fantasy genre but never feeling cliche or borrowed. Each enemy and monster feels iconic, crafted and memorable; giants, squid, demi-humans, all have visual flair and careful design aimed at eliciting emotion. There's the obvious gritty, faded European medieval setting, coupled with a supernatural, almost spiritual allure. You can't quite put your finger on it. But, it feels great to discover new areas just to experience the vertical vantage points and awe inspiring vistas now synonymous with Fromsoftware. And, are the views beautiful.Remember the first time you were airlifted into Anor Londo? Remember that exultant wash of religiosity as you gazed across the sundrenched vastness of its gothic majesty? You'll have a few of those. Whether it's stumbling into caves you thought were just 5 minute detours that end up being unbelievable 2-3 hour stand alone adventures, being chased by giant bears through dense woodland, or navigating the maze-like geometry of a massive castle, Elden Ring has surprises and delights at arms length no matter where you are in its world. It also holds up Dark Soul's challenging reputation. This game is likely tough for new players but everything you need is there to get on and succeed, whether its grinding for stats, searching for loot, summoning co-op help or just studying a boss, you are the master of your world. There's no reason anyone should be intimidated by this game. It's just damn good. The word masterpiece gets bandied around too often, but after 20 hours of gameplay I'm not seeing any indication that this game doesn't live up to that moniker. I'm expecting another 2-3 years of playing this game still won't be enough to fully discover all its secrets and gems. It's a big game. But, for now I'll simply say it's the best game I've played since Dark Souls 3 in 2016. Which is quite the wait. Enjoy this game, savour it, delight in it and remember it, as your first playthrough will be the best. Best of luck, tarnished one.",0,4

""It has PS3 graphics"", no it doesn't, you can clearly see the difference between DS3 and ER, it doesnt have next-gen graphics because its a cross-platform game, you all should be happy its available for old-gen.

""There is no story"", literally just play the game, you skipped every cutscene and now want to blame the game for something you did.
""Soundtrack is bad"", if you had at least played the game up until the first boss you would know its not bad.
""Extremely buggy and unstable"", I have to agree a little bit here, but not much, I have 50+ hours into the game, and the only bug I found was one I jumped near a cliffside, my character suddenly slides down the cliff without me touching the controller and takes damage but doesnt die, that was a one time thing, never happened again, and about Fps, yes, it does have some Fps drops some times (and very rarely), but they are almost unnoticeable, if those little drops annoy you, youre probably some **** that thinks 120 Fps is bad.

So far I am 50 hours in and the game plays smoothly 99 percent of the time! The gameplay is the best of any from software game in my opinion! Only thing stopping this game from getting a perfect score is the few (minor) bugs I have encountered like bloodstains not working. Once those get patched I would give this beautiful masterpiece a 10!,0,1
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,9,"Elden Ring is a complete Dark Souls formula, this world is a great expansion, released version and additions. More boss, more enemies, more rage. It makes me wonder what's going on behind a mountain or on that beach when I'm navigating the open world. It adds a fun look to the game called Ashes Of War. I'm playing the game with Vagabond. Vagabond is a melee character with a sword in one hand and a shield in the other, but his sword has magic skill. You should make a more average character than this character. There are spirits. You can call them with you because of your mana. There are wolves, sorcerers, soldiers, etc. They are successful in gaining acceptance based on caution, not more product-oriented than Spirits. There is an extreme boss structure in the game, but after a while the side bosses are repeated. The main bosses are very difficult. My Friend is one of the hardest Souls-Like games. Very small-scale battles take too long to hit this incremental boss, whose combos are weak. This causes you to get very angry with your personality and alienate you from the game a little bit. There are a lot of technical problems in the game. Instant FPS, little bugs, long loading screens. But in game play, it's one of the best games of the year, even the game of the year.",0,1

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,9,"Excellent jeu.

Évidemment, Elden Ring à un style de gameplay qui peut en faire abandonner plusieurs. Par contre, il s'agit, comme pour tout les autres ""souls games"", d'un jeu mettant au défis notre état d'esprit, notre mindset.

Points forts:
-D'abord, le jeu donne une très grande liberté au joueur. Cela lui permet d'être créatif.
-L'open world rend le jeu beaucoup plus immersif que ses prédécesseurs.
-Le niveau de difficulté est sincèrement varié. Certains nous semblent impossible et d'autres seront tués du premier coup.
-Elden Ring à gardé son approche de type Dark souls. (C'est ce que les adeptes veulent)
-Le décor est varié et remplit de mystère et de nouveauté.
-La jouabilité est resté un élément important pour Myazaki. L'avatar est facile à utiliser.
-Les boss sont imprésionnant et amusant à faire. Même s'ils nous tue à répétition. Nous avons l'impression d'avoir la stratégie idéale au bout des doigts, ce qui rend le joueur plus confiant et donc plus persévérant.
-La grande quantité de site of grace. Le jeu nous fais un cadeau et place des statuts ou des site de grâce près des boss. Ce qui rend la ""pratique"" plus plaisante.
-Une série de nouveaux sorts et attaques puissantes. Fort bien.
-La musique de boss est très bonne. Dès l'ouverture du jeu, j'ai pris le temps d'écouter l'œuvre musical du menu. Cela met le ton du jeu. On ressent déjà sa tristesse, mais aussi la nécessité d'être courageux. Comme si l'un nourrissait l'autre.
-Torrent, notre monture est un beau cadeau en monde ouvert. Il est aussi utile en combat et rend le jeu plus facile, et ce, significativement. Par contre, il ne peut pas être utilisé contre certains boss ne faisant pas partie de la zone ouverte du jeu. Excellent pour l'exploration.
-Les sous-terrain sont aussi des mondes cartographiés.
-L'adition des esprits (spirits) est très bien. Utile pour faire distraction et sera plutôt apprécié par les nouveau joueur qui auront besoin de répits lors des gros combats.
-L'histoire reste énigmatique, mais cela fait partie du style de Myazaki. Toutefois, elle est plus claire dans Elden Ring que dans ses prédécesseurs.
-Avoir à d'découvrir les cartes cachés est plaisant.
-L'approche punitive aux erreurs et gratifiante aux réussites : Comme tous les souls games, le jeu invite le joueur à être persévérant. Réussir les boss demandera de l'observation, l'élaboration d'une stratégie (qui s'améliore à chaque expérience) et de comprendre comment ""l'ordinateur"" est programmer. Certaines attaque sont des algorithme précis dans certaines situation. Ce qui offre une ouverture certaines aux joueurs pour ne pas être punie et, profiter d'une frappe.

Points faible:
-La musique de la zone ouverte est bien, mais aurait pu être mieux.
-Personnellement, j'ai faire le jeu en solo pour le défis. Par contre, ce qui serait plaisant, c'est d'avoir un ""multiplayer"" ou ""coop"" mieux élaborer. Plus libre et moins restraignant. Quite à ne pas permettre les trophées.",0,1

This is surely one of Fromsoftware's best work on a game and I believe everyone should experience it. The game is also spectacular looking.

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,9,"Итак, ознакомился с данным шедевром от Миядзаки сана на ps4 pro. И начну пожалуй с минусов. Не лучшая оптимизация. Из критических багов встретил только зависания в деревьях при прыжке с лошади и последующая смерть персонажа. Фреймрейт в целом приемлемый, хотя просадки есть, они, как и положено, раздражают, но в целом это не так критично. О графике трудно судить ввиду устаревшей консоли, но если говорить о картинке в целом, то она целостная. Ну и конечно же художники постарались на славу, да это не такой целостный мир, как например дс1. Но и масштабы этих миров сравнивать не очень приемлемо, как по мне. Далее о геймплее, некоторое оружие поломано. Из того что я встретил это катана реки крови, которая у меня не получила бонусов урона от скейлов и двуручник гатса, который при улучшении на +25 и закалке на тяжесть выдаёт меньше урона чем при улучшении на +24 и той же закалке, при чем меньше как базового урона, так и урона от скейла(с другими закалками такой проблемы нет). Теперь о хорошем. 65 часов, выбита платина и игра абсолютно не надоела. Боссы, исследование, чувство первооткрывателя, всё это отлично работает, особенно последнее, в силу специфики открытого мира. Играть круто и интересно, билдостроение пестрит новыми красками не забывая об истоках. Прокачаны анимации и касты многих заклинаний(в сравнении с предыдущими играми автора). Нпц и лор, в целом похожи на тот же дарк, примерная концепция та же, но есть больше дворцовых интриг, что наверняка пошло от сооавтора истории Дж. Мартина,но в целом это новый лор, новыми персонажами и событиями, опять же, схожи именно концепция, а не история. Подводя итог, лично мне как любителю серии, игра зашла абсолютно, всё чего я ожидал от игры оправдал себя. Отсылки на берсерка, мрачная, неоднозначная история, упадок мира, неочевидные квесты и конечно же крутые боссы. Смело могу заявить что лучший dark souls это  elden ring. А бал минусанул за повторяющихся мини-боссов и самую лёгкую платину в соулсборн серии Миядзаки",0,2

I went into the game and took my time, enjoyed the map and the countless hidden places and things in every corner of which there is many! I am still not 100% complete and have lots to do. Replayability is great offering so many different ways to go through the game to keep it new.
The only thing I found overtly difficult was the steep learning curve at the beginning, but don't let that dampen the brilliance of the rest of the game.

Other then that, 10/10.",0,1
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,8,"After 50 hours of playtime and beating every main boss, I can say the game is amazing. It still has it's issues, but the overall experience is one of the best I've ever had while playing a game. I played on a launch day PS4 and doing so led to a few points where the frames dropped to almost a standstill. This only happened a few times, but it's one of the reasons holding the game back from a 9 or 10. I guarantee that if I were to play this on a PS5 or RTX 3000+, the game would be near perfect.

The map is massive and has something to do no matter where you go. The only thing is, rather than telling you where to go or giving you a waypoint to follow, you have to find everything yourself. The game doesn't hold your hand in any aspect of the game including the map. You have to pay attention to near every piece of dialogue in order to pick up clues that will hint to where you need to go next.

The combat is the culmination that everything FromSoft has work on in the last decade and you can clearly tell. Shades of DS3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro are all over this game. The bosses are very difficult, but not unfair or impossible. Margit is the toughest first story boss in the series, but there are multiple ways of going about the fight. One, you can keep trying over and over. Two, you can get stronger and come back later. Or three, find an item that might help with the boss. Margit's Shackle is an item the specifically helps with this boss. Every boss provides a unique challenge and forces you to come up with unconventional solutions. One of the biggest questions the game asks you is ""Oh so you beat that boss? What if there were two of them?"" Gank bosses are very common here and some aren't very well designed.

Like most Fromsoft stories, it's very vague and up to the player whether or not they really want to pay attention to it. This comes in the form of exploration. The more exploring you do, npc's you meet, and areas you unlock, the more the story starts to come together and give you the completed story. The story is as deep and fleshed out as the player is willing to make it.

Overall the game is around a High 8 to low 9 for me. First game in a long time that makes me want to get 100% in. If you are on the edge of buying it or not, try it out and see what happens, you might just find one of your favorite games of all time.

***SPOILERS***
There are still bosses that are poorly designed. Crucible knight and misbegotten warrior is painful to play against because the developers just threw two bosses in one fight without thinking about balance or the arena they fight you in. Godskin Duo is annoying because they tried to break agro by giving you pillars to hide behind, but it doesn't matter if both mobs are the same speed and both have ranged attacks. They tried to channel the spirit of O&amp;S, but fell short. Rykard is a reskinned version of Yhorm in the way that you need a special weapon that's specifically designed for the fight in order to have a chance at winning. The elden beast is probably my least favorite boss in the game. The fact that it has so many two-shot long ranged attacks is already hard, but it constantly runs to the other side of the stage a few seconds after you close the gap makes it 100x more annoying to fight.",0,1

There's of course the new horse gameplay and combat which is very fun, new ways to craft recipes and add signature abilities to weapons, a counter attack move which is incredibly useful for shield builds, and a lot of accessability such as control mapping. Similar to the rest of the Souls library, the game does share the same frustrating quirks like still getting hit through solid walls and the occasional bug or framerate drop (at least on last-gen platforms), but that's all outshined by the incredible presentation of the Lands Between, a place filled with so much mystery it's hard resisting the urge to discover and conquor everything there is to see.

"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-4,5,"Technical issues can be fixed, so I'm rating the game based on content only.
The world is huge and beautiful but there is a LOT of empty space.
The battles bring nothing new to the table, you basically do the same thing you have been doing in every Souls game: roll and dodge the enemy's attack, roll at the wrong time and the enemy hits you, run to be at a safe distance from the enemy to be able to heal and approach the enemy once again and hit it a couple of times. Everything feels heavy and clunky and your hundreds of deaths feel somehow even more frustrating than in any Souls game. Sekiro's combat is way better, more dynamic, more visceral and more engaging. I was really hoping that Elden Ring would improve on Sekiro's combat and take it from there, but we just got the old and recycled Souls' stiff, clunky mechanics that, by now, feel stale. The rewards for killing the most tough bosses were useless most of the time: summons that I wouldn't bother trying, underwhelming talismans, average weapons that I didn't even bothered selling for their low price and other trinkets I couldn't care less about. The lore felt too vague for my taste. I know that's FS's style, but I was really expecting a big, revealing, plot-twisting ending, because my 100-hour journey was arduous and I thought I deserved a decent ending. No, the ending was short, vague and underwhelming, to the point I felt it was disrespectful. All is left for me now is hope that in From's next title, I can be immersed into a huge and beautiful world with a slightly more fathomable lore, an overwhelming, big, fulfilling ending and improved and innovative combat. The old FS's formula still might be appealing to die-hard fans, but I don't think it's going to survive much longer.",0,0

Elden Ring is the first game I've ever pre-ordered due to expectation to see more of Sekiro in the game but turns out its a complete Dark Souls with just a rebranding name with open world and some amazing feature like spirit summon and horse to help you explore the world.

Surprisingly, the performance of this game is decent. I didn't face any game-breaking issue like other players. The only issue is frame-rate drop.

I don't like Dark Souls at all which makes me kind of disappointed after playing this game but turns out its the most pleasing exploration game I've ever played. Many things to discovered and room to improve your character as well as variation to improve it.

It still bring the gene of FromSoftware as they are the best at creating the best rewarding game. I can feel I've achieved something in every moment I play this game which not easy to accomplish in gaming nowadays.

Cannot say much because its basically Dark Souls where I'm not into that game. Just hope From Software could come with another Sekiro game. Doesn't necessarily Sekiro 2 but I hope they can create new IP but this time more into Sekiro mechanic rather than Dark Souls.

Overall its a great game but the slow-paced combat is just not for me. Other than that, From Software manage to create a rich and meaningful open world in their 1st attempt with more understandable story this time around. If you a fan of open world game, I completely recommend this game as this is the most rich (not as big as) open world game ever made besides Rockstar GTA and RDR.",0,0

About as much work as he does on his own series I'd surmise, which is NOTHING. You get what amounts to lore dumps on scrolls and flavor text on items passing as a ""story."" There's no major narrative structure.

The ""revolutionary"" open world is hollow, lifeless, and boring. I've seen more intriguing open worlds in PS3 games. Speaking of PS3 games that's basically what you're getting here in the visuals department. I guess the AAA industry is so exhausted from bribing publishers and youtubers to give them good scores they don't even bother with the graphics anymore. Art direction is however stunning, seems to be where they spent most of their time.

Gameplay is seriously bogged down by numerous bugs and technical issues. Frame rate drops, save crashing, stuttering, janky animations, clipping errors, you name it this game has it. I guess all the 10/10 reviews are based on where the game will be in 2 years once they fix the bugs? That's some optimism for you!

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-one,0,"I have never played any of the Souls games before, but being a connoisseur of RPGs and hearing of this supposedly legendary RPG series I felt it was time I finally bit the bullet. I figured with Martin penning the game's story it would be rather grand involving political intrigue and riveting tales of man's inner folly. Having grown up on D&amp;D and CRPGs I expected to have a fair idea of what I was getting into.

Much to my surprise, I found a vast open world filled with nothing to do. I created my character to wander around some lifeless void. Oh, it looks rather grand the art direction is quite phenomenal though the textures muddied and the game is plagued with pop-ins as well. I am able to forgive the occasional jank for a good and true RPG. I however did not find one in this game. I'm not sure what constitutes for an RPG these days amongst the general public, but generally it's a game with roleplaying options of which this game seems to have none other than building your character's stats and skills.

All problems are solved through this game's languid, ponderous, and clunky combat. No non-combat or social options in this supposed RPG. The exploration as as dull and lifeless as the world in which it inhabits. Some scant crafting materials to create some mediocre items with minimal stat gains. Undoubtedly the usual carrot and the stick seen in the MMO sphere influenced this trash itemization.

The dungeons were quite interesting and a more linear experience and I killed Margit after ten or twelve tries. The game's molasses combat was made even more frustrating due to the various technical issues that plague this supposed RPG (Hint it's not an RPG it's just combat pornography) Your character's hitboxes are far too large causing the enemies to strike you frequently when you're clearly outside of their swing radius. There's also numerous frame rate drops making the game's sole feature of combat extremely difficult since the technical execution of the developers lack of talent is holding you back further than the difficulty of the game is.

All in all this game is not an RPG, there are no roleplaying options. It's just combat pornography for the youth's violent masturbatory sadist rituals. If you have any class avoid this buggy mess like the plague it is and cast it into the fire! I for one got a full refund from my local gamestore, but I hope to save others the expense. We all know this game doesn't deserve a perfect score.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-one,0,"Buddy told me to check this game out I used to play some action games back on the PS2. Not really my jam these days, but I figured what they hell why not. Let me tell you this is no God of War. Booted this game up thought it looked okay, kind of like an old 360 game, but whatever. Must be a good story or something.

Speaking of story I guess other than the one eyed girl and the crappy cutscene there isn't really one. Figured since it had the Game of Thrones writer on it it may be cool, but I guess this is the reason why everyone hates the damned show now. He must not be very good, probably another SJW propped up by the hollywood elites.

Dodge mechanics are pretty clunky and don't seem to work quite right.. Seems like your character's hit box is larger than Nancy Pelosi's slush fund. Clipping seems to guarantee that the enemies kill you through walls and rocks and other crap, but you never seem to go through them. I presume it's some intentional feature to create a faux sense of challenge to the game. The alternative is that the programmers lack the technical wherewithal to pull of what they're striving for. Now that I think on that though it's probably the latter with the number of bugs this game has. Frame rate drops are pretty harsh and consistently occur on boss encounters.

Maybe it would have been a cool game if the story was any interesting or if the developers were worth a lick, but they seem to be reaching for the stars when they can't even grab the dirt off the floor very well. Play God of War any of them and hard if you wanna play a real good game.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-one,4,"'When you've finished your 4th Black Forest gateau - here, have another, and try not to puke'

Putting 5-10 hours into this game gave me both a skinking sense of deja-vu and the feeling of forcing myself to eat fistfuls of overly sweet cake.

If, like me, you have played this series since Demon's Souls, you will realise Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4. Or Demon's Souls 2 - It doesn't really matter at this point.

Other than the *slightly* more open world structure (the 'Souls series was always somewhat open in structure) and Torrent the goathorse, everything is exactly the same as all the previous games, including elements from Bloodborne and Sekiro.

Same player classes and animations?
Same enemy design, including enemy types/classes?
Same pseudo-mediaeval world, with lonely atmosphere?
Same dead-eyed, hollow-voiced NPCs?
Same controls and combat system?
Same telling of the opaque story and world lore through item descriptions?
Same, boring, grindy progression system?
Same die-and-die-again repetitive gameplay?
Enroaching feeling that you are wasting your life playing updates to the same game released well over a decade ago?

'Yes' to all of the above.

Mashing together your previous 4 games and adding a horse is in no way innovative or good, by any metric. This is one of the laziest 'masterpieces' I have ever seen.

It used to be fun, but its just the same bland thing over and over again.

"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-one,3,"This game ranks amongst one of the best games in the Soulsborne genre, but it STILL lacks what is takes to be a truly great game; or even a 'good' game really.

The graphics are excellent, and the combat controls are relatively responsive, as they need to be in this genre of game. However, that being said, the game falls short on MANY fronts and demonstrates a lack of developer insight into what makes an exceptional game.

While the combat controls are very responsive, the combat in the game often devolves into enemies crowding the player, with the player fighting the in-game camera as much as they are fighting the enemies. This lack of insight, amongst other things, detracts from what could otherwise be a great game.

Competitor 'souls-like' games (e.g. Nioh) so a better job of pacing the combat properly, and offering players some room to actually see what is going on.

Undoubtedly the weebs will shout their lack-of-brain-cells, lemming-like, mantra of 'git gud', but those shouts of mindless of brainless drivel should be directed at the developers, not the players in an effort to get the devs to put forth that 'git gud' effort into overcoming their own barriers, get rid of some of these mindless, idiotic, pacing and crowding issues that mar what could otherwise be a 10/10 game.

Still, all that said, it is still a very 'good' game...and would still a solid 5/10. It really is a 'average' game; but that's just it...it's ok, not 'excellent' or 'exceptional'; it still finds itself leaning on the same tired old soulsborne tropes and cliches. The sole exception to this is that it finally brings magic back into being a viable build.

5/10 would have been as high as it could possibly go with the problems that still exist; and that have existed since the days of the soulsborne infancy.

Unfortunately the Radahn &amp; Fire Giant fights docked additional points because they stand in the way of the player as a 'mandatory' event; and those fights are quite possibly the most terrible fight design I have seen in any modern game. Look to the players, and how many ""cheese"" strategies players come up with for those two fights alone....that's your barometer for how badly you have designed a fight.

Many other boss fights are likewise a gimmick-driven mess, and not remotely 'fun'; which is the purpose of gaming is it not? That's not to say that ALL of the boss fights are bad; I would say a solid 30-40% of them are well-designed and good; however unfortunately for only 30-40% of 'good' content, the customer should only be charged about 30-40% of the MSRP cost of the game.

There's also some Game Design 101 flaws, for example many times you have to ""reload the game world"" in order for changes to take effect (e.g. you turn in a quest, and a new pathway is intended to open up; however nothing will happen until you Fast Travel somewhere, forcing the game world to reload)....I mean, seriously, c'mon From Software, that is like High School level basic game design, you guys are supposed to be pros!

All in all, it's decent, and you definitely get your money's worth from a ""time-spent"" perspective, the game is MASSIVE. So that's a positive. The problem is that From Software still fails to deliver a game that is 100% fun to play. It's about 40% fun, and 60% eye-rolling bad design and annoying. Definitely see some substantial improvements for player experience, but they still have a long way to go.

Definitely not the 10/10 experience that the weebs and fangirls are crying out.

I would have to say the biggest downfall is the continued ""lack of respect"" towards a player's playtime. My time is far too valuable to waste it doing the same things over and over again. If the dev's target audience is grade schoolers or people drawing welfare stipends, okay sure; but for honest working folk, we don't have time for repetitive garbage.

Another issue is EXCEPTIONALLY POOR quest design &amp; quality-assurance testing. There is no 'Quest Log' to track your objectives; and if that isn't cumbersome enough, most of the quests are flat-out broken, with 'triggers' not happening reliably, NPCs not appearing where they are supposed to be, etc.  Honestly, I have seen better 'Quest Design' coming out of High School computer classes; are the folks from the Quest team at From Software actually professionals; or are they just like some elementary school students that they allowed to code for some extra credit for a week?

"Mar 22, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-one,1,"Has the worst camera, lock on system and controls mechanics ever in a video game!!! Completely ruins everything good about game. Controlls are absolutely broken!

Every time you try an impossible jump and hold run you jump backwards off a cliff. The worst part is leveling up. You can't just play the game through. You'll have to spend weeks fighting the same enemies unnecessarily and repeatedly because game is so short otherwise and makes feel like boring work to the point of losing interest quickly. Absolute nonsense you unable to track any of the vague quests or side ones without googling **** Devs ought to be ashamed of themselves letting it release this way.

This game, as a continuation of their brand, is a perfect and awe-inspiring offering. For a huge fan of the Dark Souls Series this game is the ultimate fan wish-fulfillment by a game maker. The formula they've honed is nearly perfected here, and the expansion of features and ideas, gameplay and story twists and turns, and incredible presentation all add up to a game experience I will remember for all my days left on this earth.

Well that’s because to expect this game to be different than the other Fromsoft games is ignorant at best,    It takes what works from the rest of their work and finally starts to trim away from the fat that made prior games more like exclusionary niche titles and opened the genre to be much more accessible.    The game never seems to stop opening up into new areas to explore and when played alongside friends has created a gaming experience I’ve found lacking in the industry for a longerg time.    The open world allows for moving around and away from moments that served as roadblocks in prior titles.    Can’t beat that boss?    No problem, just go level up or try out a new weapon set up and come back.    No  more banging your head against the wall as you do the same fight for the 50th time.    You can go at your own place and there is more variety to the game than just big sword smash and roll.    And while the graphics are far from cutting edge, the game reminded me how little that matters in a game.    Thanks for the stories Fromsoft, can’t wait to see what’s next.",1,1
"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"Full disclosure, I am fairly big fan of the Dark Souls series of games and have been playing Souls games for nearly a decade now; so take that into consideration. With that out of the way, I would like to say that Elden Ring is simply incredible. I have not experienced a newly released RPG that has enthralled me this much with its world and gameplay since Fallout 4 - back in 2015. The diversity in builds and play styles, the humongous amount of interesting dungeons and environments, the plentiful and awesome loot, and of course the difficult but very fun to fight enemies and bosses - all of these elements are done very, very well in Elden Ring. There are some technical problems here and there, mainly with the frame rate and some controller delay - but this will not destroy the awesome experience. As a send off I want to say this, Elden Ring is not short and it does not hold your hand, this could seem overwhelming to some gamers, but I want to say that Elden Ring hardly ever felt like a chore. While Elden Ring is a long game, it's so open and has so much in it that I hardly felt like I was spending too much time playing it. Even if you are crunched for time from work or school, I still would highly recommend trying out this awesome game.",1,1

I’ve put 50hrs into this game and I still have so much more to find and do. The graphics are amazing. There isn’t 50 map markers telling me to do some lame side quest. Every other open world game has repetitive side quests. I don’t have to spend half my time playing the game picking up materials (Horizon forbidden west). I find a map and I look at it. I see something on the map that looks interesting and I go there. I get a boss fight and badass loot. This is what a Medieval style game should be like. It’s challenging. It’s a long game if you play it that way. It’s not filled with BS to have bragging rights that it takes X time to complete it. It’s An amazing experience.

"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,8,"7.5 stars. A beautiful but frustrating and flawed fantasy adventure. I didn't finish the game. The endless bosses and recycled areas towards the end were too much for me. I am looking forward to playing a real game with a real story now. But this game was pleasant enough and fascinating to play for the first 30-40 hours, then its flaws begin to become apparent.

The lack of armour, meaningful RPG elements, weapons, direction, story, and lack of polish in combat and boss battles. Not to mention getting killed through walls, glitches, poorly implemented multiplayer, and zero character development or journal to aid in your adventures. However, these flaws are greatly overlooked in favour of the beautiful world, and I suppose that is the case with most reviewers.

But, make no mistake, this is a VERY frustrating game! Which is a shame. Because it is needlessly so. As of writing, almost two weeks after its release, judging from achievements, only 15% of players have finished it yet. I won't be one of those people, I have better things to do than waste hours on boss after boss after boss. But it was a lovely world for the first 30 hours and might be worth buying just to experience it for that alone, but afterwards, prepare for an unpleasant time, quite often, interlaced with fascination at the world design.",1,1

"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"This is possibly the best game I have ever played. The open world feels so exciting all the time. Compared to the standard Ubisoft game, which boasts a huge map, despite the fact that travelling is tedious and time consuming, elden ring’s world properly encourages exploration by rewarding the player no matter what direction they explore. In my opinion, the best thing about the game is the fact that it truly lets you do whatever the hell you want to. In previous fromsoft titles, new areas were completely locked behind a major boss fight, whereas in elden ring, you can find your way around just about everything if you look hard enough. Fromsoftware uses this feature in a super creative way by adding teleporting devices and even trap chests, which teleport the player to a high level area which the player can either choose to warp back home or explore this dangerous area for very valuable loot.It’s a shame people are trying to tarnish (get it) it’s reputation simply because they think they deserve for the game to be made exactly their way",1,1

Mountaintop of the Giants and beyond, the enemies get a huge spike in health and damage, while if you’ve properly explored your damage may be reaching its max with +10/+25 weapon and the soft cap for your attack attribute.

With dangers around every corner and bosses ranging from small to towering giants this game has it all, the added ability to play with your friends and explore together is a much loved bonus. Because sometimes (most times) you'll find yourself needing that extra hand to help defeat a boss or dungeon. No friends to play eith? No worries elden rings also gives you thr ability early on to summon spirits to your side to help you fight and defeat enemies as well as summon random players from other worlds into yours to help, along with you being summoned to theirs if wanted.

As always Fromsoftware fails to fix its bugs and glitches.  World rendering, Weapon clipping and hitbox issues. However a majority of the bosses are fresh and fun and great. Some bosses are just lazy but other Dark  Souls games have had this issue. But this doesnt excuse them from repeating the mistake. I am aiming to give a fair review because I feel a ton of the reviews have been inflated and are not living in reality. The Lore falls short and flat compared to its siblings of Dark Souls and Bloodborne but makes up for it for the fresh attempt. I am writing it a 7 for the boring first few hours of the game. It really does pick up near the end of the game but it is not a masterpiece by any means. It is good, not great and not perfect.

Zero storyline.. apparently it’s a uNiQue MeTHoD of Storytelling.. but seems to me just a way to 1) not have to pay for voice actors because almost every NPC apart from a choice few are complete mutes even human characters 2) hiding the lack of programming ability to maintain loops or behaviors for the NPCs - so a) everytime you touch a grace or fast travel anywhere - every NPC / flower / bird goes back to the same exact spot and starts their day like some weird Truman show - Groundhog Day **** b) no immersion and no permanence in the game - might as well just run past every bad guy until you get the main boss because as soon as you go somewhere to level up every single bad guy will be reincarnated in the exact same spots, walk the exact same paths and do the exact same thingc) the can’t program interactions with the bosses with the environment well and limited environmental destruction so they have to lock you in the room with every boss so you ‘can’t escape’ but realistically it’s because they can’t program these creatures to interact with the world C) Making the game a complete grind to level up “to make the game difficult and rewarding” - nah bollocks - it’s just because the game is much more shallow than it advertised and so it makes pointless grinding and one hit kill bosses you have to flawlessly fight again and again just to pad out this lifeless game. I mean seriously? How do these giant monsters survive underground in a cave etc with no food - it makes zero sense..

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"I don‘t understand the bad reviews. Never experienced any frame drops on performance mode and the game looks beautiful. Apart from that the gameplay loop is probably the best I‘ve seen in recent years. Never have I been so addicted to a video game that I played it over 30 hours on the first 3 days and I still only scratched the surface. The game rewards you every time you venture off the main path and not by giving you some collectibles like in other open world games but with a new weapon, skill, spell, armor or talisman that will help maybe help your current build or is even worth building towards. The sense of progression you get this way is incomparable to other open world games or rpgs. I started out as a naked guy with a stick, went on to be a knight with a bastard sword and shield and now am a powerful scythe wielding sorcerer using the power of dragons and lightning to destroy my enemies.

I can understand some people that got drawn in by the BOTW comparisons are having trouble with the combat but it‘s definitely not too hard if you‘re willing to think a little bit about how to approach boss fights. The summons definitely help a lot and sometimes even make the game feel too easy for a fromsoft game.",7,12
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,5,"Where do I begin on this title and the insanely inflated hype around it? Elden Ring is yet another entry to the Souls genre, and this time steps away from the tried and true design of tightly crafted game worlds that Fromsoft usually brings us. Unfortunately, we are left with a bland and lifeless Overworld, connected with obscured dungeons that feel copied straight from Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons. There was something missed in translation here, as most open worlds draw you in with a plethora of things to experience, not just empty space between the next thing to kill.
Speaking of killing, the entire game revolves around removing enemies out of your way. This is the same as every Souls game, but this is supposed to be an open world experience. Imagine just laying a linear game out on top of a big map and calling it ""open world"" now. With nothing else to do, you will be traveling across large, empty expanses to find another repetitive dungeon, another rehashed enemy, another reskinned boss...with rewards that do not give you incentive to explore. You hit walls where you cannot pass, so you must go try a different route until you are strong enough to do the ""intended"" route. You will begin to lose steam after the honeymoon phase wears off.

The bosses get progressively more ridiculous as you move through the game. Instead of opting for a dance of combat like Bloodborne or Sekiro, you will spend the entire battle rolling around, counting on iframes to help scrape you out of a 9-hit combo alive, where each hit of the combo can chunk you for most of your health. Enemies everywhere rely on delay attacks, holding their weapons in the air just until you finish rolling for a cheap kill. Some will defy physics and spin midair to land on you. The whole thing is about being cheesed by enemies or cheesing them by leveling. Even having the strongest physical defense armor in the entire game, plus dumping most of your points into Vigor, you will still be 2 shot by end bosses. Highly disappointing.

The ""open world"" is rife with shambling creatures that walk in circles or wait patiently for you to approach and dispatch them.  NPC stand around, lifeless in this uninspired world. You cannot track any quests, so unless you have a really good memory, you are expected to play with a journal by your side for notes. The UI used is ugly and over a decade old. Movement is nearly a direct copy from Dark Souls 3, with weapon Arts.

The biggest crime here, though, is the reviews from Critics. Unanimously overflowing 10/10 review from nearly every gaming company out there. For a continuation of pretty niche type of game, the how is unreal. Especially when NOTHING here is revolutionary, inventive, or deserving of the word ""masterpiece."" At best it is bait to get people to buy Elden Ring, only to be highly disappointed after the refund return window has closed.

Lastly, the hype of George RR Martin to sell the game! This is just using a name to sell your product. You can replace entire words with phrases from Dark Souls. Point of Lost Grace = Bonfire.

Watch reviews (not 10/10 ""critic"" reviews, but actual USER reviews), check out some gameplay. Read reddit posts that are not biased towards it being great. Don't just jump on a train taking gaming in the wrong direction.",4,7
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,7,"Very disappointing overall.

The graphics are dated, and would have been considered poor on the previous generation of console hardware.  Optimisation and performance is even worse, and suffers from a feeling of frames skipping.  I haven't tried on a monitor with VRR but I understand that may improved the experience.

In terms of gameplay.  Combat will be very familiar to anyone who has played the Souls games.  The open world environment does little to change the overall gameplay arc and experience, and as such fans of the series will be very happy with the amount of content in the game.  For me however, it was disappointing that so little has changed from previous games and it falls back on the same pattern learning and repetition as previous titles.

Not a bad game by any means, but you should ignore any 10/10 review.",10,18
"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,6,"This isn't a great game. It's merely good.  It's got way too many technical issues, like frame drops and screen tearing throughout. Visually, there is nothing impressive. It looks similar to Bethesda games over a decade old, or Neverwinter. There's not much of a story. It's overly long just to be long. If you're an open world fan, this game has a gigantic open world that you can pretty much explore at will.  However, the gaming ""media"" has severely overrated this game.  It should be sitting 65 to 70, not the 90 whatever it has.  Way way way too many technical flaws on all consoles and PC.",5,9
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,6,"Performance issues, network issues at launch make me wonder where all tge perfect scores came from. VRR makes the performance issues manageable. It's a fun game but I just don't see much fresh besides it being Dark Souls with an Open World. It has lore but no storytelling. It's the same mechanics. If you are new to the series nothing is explained properly. You'll be looking for guides everywhere so it breaks immersion.If you are into Soulsborne games and want to see an open world version I recommend it. If not stay away. The exploration can be super fun and darkly beautiful but beyond frustrating at times as well. The coop system is still the same so no updates to it as well. I unfortunately thought it was a big evolution but the only thing that's changed is am open world, a horse and you can a summon AI help at times. To me it's fun but can feel extremely tedious.",8,15
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,9,"For me this game is amazing, the atmosphere for this game kept me in awe throughout most of the game, and althought fromsoft kept the games difficulty hard, they added multiple classes so people can pick a class they are most comfortable with, which in my opinion, makes the player have a lot more choice in this than other fromsoft games.",9,17

If you can't appreciate cryptic story telling, and don't enjoy the mysterious wonder it brings, this game isn't for you.

This game is a breath of fresh air among the convoluted and bloated open world game we typically get today. It's a masterclass in level design, enemy design, combat, RPG mechanics, exploration, dungeon crawling, and more. The game is absolutely massive in scale, and with 50 hours in I've hardly scratched the surface. The reviews are justified and the hype is real.

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,5,"This is my biggest video-game-disapointment ever.
A dark souls game of extreme quality, that has been opened for the casual gamer. That was my expectation. Now, 30 hours of later, im deinstalling, and am not going to ever play this, nor buy any From Software game ever again...

Honestly: I regret the 30 hours of frustration i had, and the hilarious amount i paid for it.
It basically is just a fighting simulator. There is nothing more in this game. Run around, fight difficult to impossible (for me) battles, grind endlessly, progress extremely slowly, and, from time to time, discover items that may or may not be useful for you.
You will die a lot, lose all character progress regulairly, and generally, have no idea what this game is actually about. The story is non-existent, the world is extremely lifeless, and just filled with enemies that wait only or you, and the storyline will come to an end pretty fast, because you will just not be able to beat the bosses. At least, if you are a casual gamer iike me.
Which forces you to battle easy opponents forever, as rewards and character developement are hardly more than a cosmetic feature.

Of course there are ways to exploit the game, but as soon as i need youtube in a tab to achieve any chance of progression, a game has failed for me.

My last experience in this game, after exploring the whole starting region desperately, was a sorceress who finally enabled me to learn new spells. Which gave me hope, that the torture had come to an end.
And guess what: Those spells are far weaker than the weak ones, that you start with. Its a slap in the face, and im sure, that its an intended one.

I am someone who loved Zelda, Witcher 3 and more recently AC Valhalla and I think to compare this to Zelda and Witcher is actually insulting and a disgrace!After putting about 10 hours of frustration, disappointment and no fun I have deleted and got my money back from Microsoft.

"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,7,"I got Elden Ring on launch day and was blown away with it. The scenery is great, music is nice, plays like Dark Souls, I was in heaven.

But the the major bosses are just very, very unfair. I'm a FromSoft veteran who's completed the King's Field and Dark Souls series, Bloodborne and Sekiro multiple times. This game isn't difficult like Sekiro or Bloodborne difficult. Those bosses were challenging, but very do-able. The problem I have, is that the majority of bosses in Elden Ring just spam attacks absolutely non-stop with infinite FP and stamina, leaving an absolute minuscule window to get hits in. Soloing this game is nigh-on impossible, especially late game when the difficulty is rammed even higher and suddenly.

These games, which heavily punish the player for mindless aggression, Miyazaki is quite happy to not apply that rule to his AI. And it proves how BS a boss is when noone even drops down co-op summon signs, because they don't want to go through that certain boss again.

I'm not saying it needs to be made easier, just a little evenly balanced. But then maybe try and embrace a wider audience by adding a slightly easier mode? All you need to do really is keep runes on death, that's it. But that's just me.

Rated it a 7 out of 10, because outside of the major bosses, this is a fun game, which I enjoyed with great exploration and design.",1,2

For example, the inventory is so clunky and dated. Key information on items stats is hidden, for a “core” game this should be easily accessible. Most of the game’s difficulty comes from obfuscation of the game’s mechanics, so you have to resort to online guides &amp; walkthroughs.

I went into this game with an open mind and loved it. this game is blowing my mind. plus I play on the series s and the game looks insane.

Sifu had way smoother gameplay and animations and Horizon feels like it is 5 years in advance in terms of visuals, the difference is gigantic. So what I think the game did good and bad:

Good:
+ World design
+ Exploration
+ Art design
+ Variety of enemies in the world
+ And let's say the level design

Bad:
- Graphics (textures, lighting, shadows, etc, feels like a 2014 title, not 2022 one)
- Voice acting, mocap, lip-sync (insanely bad for a AAA developer)
- Story (super generic, vague, diluted, the dialogs and characters are super cringe)
- Clunky controls
- Animations
- Sound effects (again super generic)
- 60Hz cap?? in 2022?
- Optimization, stuttering (for pc at least and for now, maybe it will be fixed with a patch)",8,17

This game brings all the best from all fromsoftware games, even Sekiro, to build up the best game you can ask for. THERE IS A REASON but Souls games are not for everyone, the game doesn´t hold your hand, doesn´t babysit you, it challenges you, it brings the best of you, not everyone are truly comfortable with this kind of liberty, many need a hand on their shoulders.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,5,"My impressions after about 15 hours of gameplay:
First of all, an open world game should offer the user as much interaction with the world as possible (i.e. RDR2). Apart from killing the bad guys, there is little interaction. The NPCs are scarce (where is everybody)? It's 95% enemies. Sure, you can collect stuff but that doesn't make this world a more interactive place.
Then, there is no real story. There is no substantial narrative. I'm not saying that a game should take you by the hand and lead you from one quest to the next, but the total lack of any guidance feels like there is no story at all (apart from killing everybody of course). I have no idea about the involvement of George R.R. Martin, but after 15 hours the scenario eludes me.
Sure the aesthetics of the game are fantastic, the imagery is breathtaking, but apart from that it feels like you are playing a bad version of Mortal Combat (because you only have a couple of moves and the enemies have about 100) disguised as a R.P.G.",7,15

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"This is my first game from FromSoft and so far my experience has been challenging but so rewarding. I haven’t felt this way about an open world game since Breath of the Wild. Exploration is continually rewarded in the world. The bosses are difficult but there’s always the option to leave and come back to fight another day once you’ve leveled up and gained more knowledge. I recommend players keep a notebook or notes file on their computer/phone open to keep track of important details that may be forgotten if not written down. If you’re feeling frustrated by a part of this game, this is most likely by design. It never hurts to use the internet to look up a topic you may be confused about.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,0,"I played this game for about 7 hours last night and I agree, it sucks. On my Xbox Series S it stutters at about 30 fps which is not what you expect from a “masterpiece” released in 2022. The “open world” is just a large area with lots of enemies. There are no towns or NPC’s to talk to besides a few merchants. I think I found one side quest. No matter what direction you go in the difficulty is high which forces you to grind, an rpg quality that should have been put to bed with 90’s SNES RPG titles.
The combat system is serviceable but it’s not enough to get past its other faults. Unfortunately reviews are filled with fanboys of the series and people that jump on the “masterpiece” bandwagon.
And before anyone comes out and says, ""lmao you're not a TRUE SOULS REDDIT GAMERLORD"", I have to ask you what the appeal of these games are?
There's no plot in sight, aside from the premise of reassembling the McGuffin Ring to save the world. The game expects you to follow a linear path of progression for the first 2 hours without even so much as a waypoint, so you're just left to die to mobs over and over until you get sick of it and check a walkthrough.
I can play and enjoy hard games, I ran through Doom Eternal on Ultra Nightmare and had a lot of fun with DMC 5 on Dante Must Die. The problem I have isn't that the game is hard, it's too damn convoluted. I'm not getting kicked down because I mistimed a dash or didn't have my combos down, but because the game straight up doesn't tell you what it wants.
The simple fact is that most gamers are willing to put in the hours to master a difficult game so long as they're having fun. People invested years into games like Command and Conquer or Age of Empires because the games were enthralling, the difficulty is just a means to an end. But if a player is getting punished by a dev that thinks trial and error is compelling gameplay, the I'll call it quits. There is no pride for me in beating a game that is meant to be beaten, or solving a puzzle that was meant to be solved. No matter how hard they are, the fun is what takes precedent.
And if trying and guessing to stay on the linear path in an ""Open World game"" is fun for you, then go ahead. But I'm not regretting my refund.
That's not even talking about the atrocious performance and terrible optimization. Holy **** why does this game run so bad?! The open world is entirely barren with no crowds, NPCs, traffic or large buildings to render. The thing looks almost as barren as the Shadow of the Colossus, and somehow runs 20x worse than that game does on next generation hardware!
How is this OK?",4,9
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,0,"First off, it doesn't matter how big the game is, or how good the graphics are, or how much you like the series. Absolutely none of that matters if you aren't having fun while playing the game.

With that said, this is easily the least fun (and most infuriating) game I've ever played. The performance issues are one thing, that can easily be fixed, but doing the same things over and over and over again simply isn't fun.... and dying is the CORE FEATURE of the game. Even the lead designer said so. Why From Software believes that you have to die thousands of time to make the game is good is beyond my comprehension. They are simply wrong and there are infinite examples of amazing games that do not partake in this cheap b.s., which proves it isn't necessary.

The coop made Dark Souls 3 much more enjoyable, i.e., if you got stuck somewhere you didn't HAVE TO restart 100 times and waste 5 hours being frustrated. Rather you could just summon someone and suddenly the game is much more fair and FUN. Unfortunately, in Elden Ring, the Coop is almost non-existent. I just spend the last 3 hours trying to get help fighting a boss. I was able to successfully summon another player 1/20 tries, which took me about 10 minutes per. That is insane. So I can either waste my time playing the same boss over and over again until I smash the game, or I can stare at my monitor while I wait 10 minutes for a summon. Either option, imo, isn't playing a game.... it's either frustration or staring at a screen. I submit that NO BODY wants to do either. The one time I needed to summon two people it was impossible. The first person ALWAYS left while waiting 10+ minutes for another player.

Lastly, the game on PC crashes ALOT... and you can be HEAVILY punished when this happen (i.e., having to redo hours of game you've already played due to the crash). I'd guess my game soft locks every hour or so, which is beyond unacceptable. Easily the highest crash rate of any game I have ever played.

Bottom line, for me, the game isn't fun. At all. Yes the graphics are cool and etc, but AGAIN, absolutely none of that matters because I hate playing the game. It isn't simply not fun, it's infuriating. Hard games can be fun (God of War series) without being cheap, but cheap games, like elden ring, are specifically programmed to kill you no matter what you do, and that simply makes no sense for the vast majority of gamers. We want to PLAY the game, not be killed endlessly because the programmers designed it to do so. A good example of this is the attack-tracking by enemies. You can predict where you think their attack will land and dodge out of the way, which would make sense, but the enemy will just lock on and hit you regardless. If I can't predict where the hit is going to land, obviously I can't use the dodge button to any practical existent. All you can do is dodge, cross your fingers, and hope the auto-lock somehow misses you. I would rather use strategy to defeat an enemy rather than crossing my fingers and fighting the same enemy 50 times.",7,16

I disagree with that, a lot needs to be improved.-We should be able to experience the beautiful open world with current gen graphics if we have a PC, Series X, or PS5. Instead the graphics are extremely dated. Critics placed great emphasis on areas such as Graphics for games like Halo Infinite but didn’t seem to mention them for ER.-The button mapping needs improving.

Everything one shots you even when you’re leveled up, it’s just not as good as the other from soft games. I don’t know what they were thinking with this.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,0,"Buddy told me to check this game out I used to play some action games back on the PS2. Not really my jam these days, but I figured what they hell why not. Let me tell you this is no God of War. Booted this game up thought it looked okay, kind of like an old 360 game, but whatever. Must be a good story or something.

Speaking of story I guess other than the one eyed girl and the crappy cutscene there isn't really one. Figured since it had the Game of Thrones writer on it it may be cool, but I guess this is the reason why everyone hates the damned show now. He must not be very good, probably another SJW propped up by the hollywood elites.

Dodge mechanics are pretty clunky and don't seem to work quite right.. Seems like your character's hit box is larger than Nancy Pelosi's slush fund. Clipping seems to guarantee that the enemies kill you through walls and rocks and other crap, but you never seem to go through them. I presume it's some intentional feature to create a faux sense of challenge to the game. The alternative is that the programmers lack the technical wherewithal to pull of what they're striving for. Now that I think on that though it's probably the latter with the number of bugs this game has. Frame rate drops are pretty harsh and consistently occur on boss encounters.

Maybe it would have been a cool game if the story was any interesting or if the developers were worth a lick, but they seem to be reaching for the stars when they can't even grab the dirt off the floor very well. Play God of War any of them and hard if you wanna play a real good game. I'll be taking this back to gamestop and telling them the damned thing is broken to get my money back because it's just awful.",3,7
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,0,"I have never played any of the Souls games before, but being a connoisseur of RPGs and hearing of this supposedly legendary RPG series I felt it was time I finally bit the bullet. I figured with Martin penning the game's story it would be rather grand involving political intrigue and riveting tales of man's inner folly. Having grown up on D&amp;D and CRPGs I expected to have a fair idea of what I was getting into.

Much to my surprise, I found a vast open world filled with nothing to do. I created my character to wander around some lifeless void. Oh, it looks rather grand the art direction is quite phenomenal though the textures muddied and the game is plagued with pop-ins as well. I am able to forgive the occasional jank for a good and true RPG. I however did not find one in this game. I'm not sure what constitutes for an RPG these days amongst the general public, but generally it's a game with roleplaying options of which this game seems to have none other than building your character's stats and skills.

All problems are solved through this game's languid, ponderous, and clunky combat. No non-combat or social options in this supposed RPG. The exploration as as dull and lifeless as the world in which it inhabits. Some scant crafting materials to create some mediocre items with minimal stat gains. Undoubtedly the usual carrot and the stick seen in the MMO sphere influenced this trash itemization.

The dungeons were quite interesting and a more linear experience and I killed Margit after ten or twelve tries. The game's molasses combat was made even more frustrating due to the various technical issues that plague this supposed RPG (Hint it's not an RPG it's just combat pornography) Your character's hitboxes are far too large causing the enemies to strike you frequently when you're clearly outside of their swing radius. There's also numerous frame rate drops making the game's sole feature of combat extremely difficult since the technical execution of the developers lack of talent is holding you back further than the difficulty of the game is.

All in all this game is not an RPG, there are no roleplaying options. It's just combat pornography for the youth's violent masturbatory sadist rituals. If you have any class avoid this buggy mess like the plague it is and cast it into the fire! I for one got a full refund from my local gamestore, but I hope to save others the expense. We all know this game doesn't deserve a perfect score.

How could have almost perfect grades? I just don't get it, it's full of bugs, pop up, fog, etc. Those who rated it forgave all this just like that. That does not mean that repeating the formula gives you many hours of exploration and why not? of frustration.

Putting 5-10 hours into this game gave me both a skinking sense of deja-vu and the feeling of forcing myself to eat fistfuls of overly sweet cake.

If, like me, you have played this series since Demon's Souls, you will realise Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4. Or Demon's Souls 2 - It doesn't really matter at this point.

Other than the *slightly* more open world structure (the 'Souls series was always somewhat open in structure) and Torrent the goathorse, everything is exactly the same as all the previous games, including elements from Bloodborne and Sekiro.

Same player classes and animations?
Same enemy design, including enemy types/classes?
Same pseudo-mediaeval world, with lonely atmosphere?
Same dead-eyed, hollow-voiced NPCs?
Same controls and combat system?
Same telling of the opaque story and world lore through item descriptions?
Same, boring, grindy progression system?
Same die-and-die-again repetitive gameplay?
Enroaching feeling that you are wasting your life playing updates to the same game released well over a decade ago?

'Yes' to all of the above.

Mashing together your previous 4 games and adding a horse is in no way innovative or good, by any metric. This is one of the laziest 'masterpieces' I have ever seen.

It used to be fun, but its just the same bland thing over and over again.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,1,"I personally think this game is overhyped. *Note, i have played this game for 10 hours.

Now before you rage at least hear me out, or i dunno read the summary at the end.

Now to be fair, this game has next gen graphics that are beautiful and certainly one for your desktop wallpaper but not that much else.
The character design is in depth and makes you feel like you have inserted yourself into this world.

BUT,

The AI in this game is abysmal, they patrol the same line no matter what, day in and day out. Their perception is absolutely atrocious and you can sneak around them easily, too easily. You can also just sprint around literally any enemy and effectively become invincible. For a triple A release i do expect better. You end up killing the same footsoldiers in the same forest over and over which slows progress to a complete halt. Oh yeah, and THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT CORPSES. Come on man, at least be cautious about a **** corpse in the road. The voice acting also leaves this game with something to be desired. Every line feels like it is delivered with no emotion, anger or despair. Nothing.

The ""open world"" is also very open, true, BUT it fails to fill its openness which is very disappointing. It fills itself with these stale enemies that feel like robots, not humans. Some loot that is completely useless for a majority of the game and vast expanses of admittedly beautiful views. BUT THE FOLIAGE is atrocious. The animation when you look closely is the same waving back and forth of stale fronds despite the direction of wind. Everything feels plastic with moving parts like a machine which is disappointing to say the least.

The combat also is very clunky. I have played as bandit and astrologer and both control pretty badly. If you dodge continuously you effectively become invincible which defeats the purpose of good timing. The stamina recharges so quickly it might as well not even be a mechanic. The flasks are a good system that i can appreciate but the way they refuel is silly. Having to kill a group of enemies is stupid as it is inconsistent with which groups you can gain them on. Also lack of invulnerability frames means one attack can spell immediate death on you which is frustrating and leaves me feeling cheated.

There is very little indication of where you are meant to go at all. I understand it is an open game but the only clue is the direction of the light shining from the light respawn point things which do this regardless of level meaning you might end up fighting the first real boss with the same gear you started off with, unfortunately i fell into this trap.

Even furthermore, a complete lack of story, or at least a well explained version at the beginning leaves me feeling like there is no point to anything you do. The vague explanation in the powerpoint presentation ""cutscene"" at the beginning is not very motivational and does not make me want to discover what a tarnished is or why i want the elden ring so much. Even if it elaborates later into the story, i'm afraid it will be too little, too late.

In summary, i must declare this game a victim of over hyping. Too high expectations have crashed this hype train. I will admit, amazing graphics (that aren't plants) and a good premise. However a combination of terrible AI, bad voice acting, an empty husk of a world, bad combat and an utterly unforgiving and vaguely signed world makes for a terrible first experience.

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,Hands down this is the BEST game I’ve played in 10 yrs. I have 100+ hrs into it and still haven’t seen and done everything and not once got bored or tired of it. This is basically what I call an open open world game. It doesn’t hold your hand and tell you how great you are. You earn your way through it every step and it takes a lot of what made Zelda/Skyrim great and puts some Dark Souls into them. It’s utterly brilliant and the themes and art are incredible. If this was the last game I ever played I’d be at peace with it. Best $ I ever spent on anything in last decade. Only drawbacks are fact it’s not a showboat title for graphics and it’s tough until you figure it out. When you do-it’s best experience in gaming.,1,3

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,9,Games good. Its another FromSoft special. People complaing about graphics generaly dont know what bad graphics are because they are from this generation of hardware. The difficulty is what makes these games if you cant start like everyone else at the start of the game go do something else. This game is based on your skill as a player if you find a stratagy that works you win if you dont you die. I said this before game developers need to add an acheivment of I bought that or I earned that. You get a Trophe by beating the game on a base difficulty that ships with game or you can buy the trophe for a doller and yhey give you a game breaking weapon. The point is you ether have the skill to win or admit you cant do it and have a mark that shows it. If your not haveing fun why are you playing after you desided the game isnt to your taste? That doesnt make a game bad it means you didnt enjoy it. I saw a 0 review on here saying that the deves promised the game would have there language avalable. I understand this persons review. If the deves posted offically that the game would be in my language and it wasnt id be negative to.,1,3

"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,8,"Elden Ring has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time. The world and aesthetic is beautiful and I find myself frequently getting sidetracked by some new dungeon or a unique town or area that just makes me want to explore it all. The combat is as fluent as ever, FromSoft has perfected their style and it's as fun as it has ever been. I've seen people talk about how bad the graphics are or how many issues they've discovered. The graphics may be somewhat dated, but it doesn't take away from how much I enjoyed the game. The only issue I've come across was when I was trying to load into a friend's world to help them with a boss, but when I loaded I received the ""enemy felled"" message and was sent back to my world. The issue was quickly resolved though, but was still annoying at the time. The story is vague, like many other FromSoft games, but there is just so much more in just item descriptions alone that interested me. I haven't beaten every boss yet, but I have dumped 60 hours into the game and overcome some of the more challenging enemies in the game. The fights are tough, but always fair. I haven't encountered a boss that was that I genuinely didn't enjoy fighting. My only issue are the sidequests. Sometimes they're hard to keep track of and some of the npcs would move to a location that just seemed random until the added context later in the quest, . Eventually it made sense, but it didn't make it any less tedious trying to find where they were in the massive world. I know FromSoft likes to be minimalistic with stuff like that, but some kind of log to just keep track of what quest I had started would have been appreciated. Overall, the game isn't the most graphically advanced and definitely has some issues, but I've been enjoying the game so much despite the few issues I did run into. The world is aesthetically beautiful and there are endless possibilities with exploration still left. I can't wait to fill out the rest of my map and maybe find some secret areas and fell more enemies.",1,3
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,0,"Well, I definitely don’t recommend this game. The gameplay is awkward and repetitive, not satisfied playing it. The world is totally empty, not vast and rich as some reviewers are saying, everything looks flat and same all the time. The graphics could be better, physics and animations are very poor, considering the recent high quality games, NPC’s animations during conversations not exist. It is a joke! Sound FX are below average and repetitive. As Link the character can’t speak, combat is not responsive, story is too weak. Really a LAZY job. So it is a disappointment and totally below the expectations of the new gen games.",4,13

You should be ashamed of bluepoint. If we leave this aside there's a lot of sloppy work in the game. They enlarged a normal enemy in sekiro, bloodborne and dark souls and added it to the game as a boss. The venues were the same.  How many more times will you use Anor Londo? Even the animations are the same. Also controller does not vibrate once. Aren't you ashamed to do this?  I don't understand how they give 10 to this game. Did you get any money from the producers?

If you're tired of being treated like a child and have the patience to overcome death itself then I'd highly recommend this game, but if not then there's horizon forbidden West.There's no checklist simulator here, just an open world full of mystery and wonder. So many hidden places you'll find for the first time on your third playthrough. It's truly incredible seeing a dev team trust the player as far too often games are too proud of their work, so they feel the need to drag you to every place on the map, but elden ring wants you to discover the magic of this world on your own.. this is your journey, your path to cut, this is your world.

Mi pare che la recensione sia molto esauriente e mette in chiaro che, se siete fan del genere è un titolo imprescindibile. Se avete abbandonato le altre opere di Miyazaki definendole ingiocabili o troppo difficili, anche se più vario e più bello, Elden Ring non vi piacerà.

It can be a rough go for those not used to this style of a game but my advice is to not give up, if you get stuck on a boss or a big enemy maybe explore the world more, level up and try again. If you have a friend, get them to help you out or use summoning spirit's! Watch some tutorials on YouTube, the game doesn't give you much info on mechanics and tips. You will die, a lot. You will lose souls..... I mean runes, hopefully not a lot but it will happen. I've learned after playing all the Souls games,  you roll with the punches, laugh it off and have fun! I love the visuals, though they have some rough edges,  the sounds is great and the gameplay is fantastic once you understand it.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,9,"I'm only rating Elden Ring's single player, as I haven't played the multiplayer yet.

Elden Ring is truly a masterpiece. FromSoftware didn't promise too much. The game has a huge open world that encourages exploration. However, it still feels like a Souls game and that's great. I felt exploring the world a bit like exploring the world of Zelda: BOTW which ironically has been called the Dark Souls of Zelda games. There's something to discover at every turn in Elden Ring, and the Spirit Steed is a good addition and fun to explore the world with your steed. However, I have to deduct one point, the game does not perform very well and can rarely reach 60 FPS and hangs in FPS mode rather at 40-50 FPS. I can't speak for PS5 and PC, but have heard from friends that they have similar performance issues on both PC and Playstation.

Bottom line, Elden Ring is as big as FromSoftware promised and it's the perfect start to the new year. Unfortunately, the lack of optimization drags the game down a bit for me, which is why I only give it 9 out of 10 points. If you can overlook this point, however, Elden Ring has great potential to become GOTY.",1,6

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"Nostalgia. It's big business now. Seems like everyone is cashing in on 80's and 90's kids childhoods. But why? Why are people willing to pay money for something old and possibly obsolete? The simple answer is bliss. That exhilaration of feeling something new, The unlimited Thrill of receiving a reword for achieving what felt like an imposable goal that only a child can know. The first time you were excited and scared at the same time, The friendships...friendships before drama, when the only thing required to be friends was that you were all young and ignorant of an adult world. As we know being an adult isn't nearly as exciting and is rarely fun. So of course people (like me) in there 30's 40's and 50's will pay cash for a chance at feeling that bliss, if only for a single second, if only one more time.

Video games were my very first love. Karate Kid on the NES is the first game I remember playing. And it called to me. The colors racing by, the thrill of surviving one more screen as I scrolled right kicking and punching. Then at the local arcade it was WWF Wrestlefest and Afterburner that gave me that same thrill, That sense of pure bliss. Other games made me feel that way over the years. But it came fewer and farther between as I got older. And it wasn't just games feel this way. It was going to a new friends house for the first time, playing in a construction area at night, riding my first wheelie on my bike, my first ollie, exploring abandoned houses with my friends. when we were kids it was pure bliss all the time.

As life carries on, there are still wonders. the first time being intimate with someone, falling in love, your first promotion at work. But for most of us our day to day life's have become the status quo, go to work, be a good parent, and a good spouse. But no matter how good your life turns out, for a lot of us there will always be a longing for that bliss. That feeling of discovery we had so many years ago.

Eldon Ring absolutely makes me feel that way again. I cant exactly say why. I never liked any of the other games made by FROM software. In fact I disliked them. But this game has kept me on the edge of my seat for the 30 hours I've put into it. I'm glued to my TV in a way that I haven't been for years. My heart races, and my adrenaline has been off the charts! Not just the game either, I've had my laptop In front of me the whole time, on forums, wiki's, and watching YouTube videos. Its the most ""fun"" I've had as long as I can remember. Around every corner is something new and exciting, every cave, Ruin, or castle is just absolutely filled with discovery. The constant fear of losing your progressions is ever looming giving this game that fear and excitement feeling from my youth. There is nothing like discovering an area with no messages anywhere and knowing you might be the first player to ever find this place. It's constant exhilaration.

I could get into the mechanics, the graphics, what features the game has or lacks. But I wont. I could talk about the length of the game. But I also wont, Because for me it doesn't matter. Im 30 hours in and if the game ended now, or lasted another 100 hours I would consider it the greatest game ever made. What I do care about is how this game makes me feel. And it makes me feel like a kid again. Not for a second, but for hours. I never thought I would feel these kinds of emotions again. And for that I am so thankful.

I usually dont write reviews, But I had to let someone somewhere know how amazing this game is. In my opinion this game is without a doubt the G.O.A.T..",0,2
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"I'm absolutely loving the game.  There are way more bosses in this game than in previous Souls games but it has a better quality of life updates.  For example, all bosses have a very close respawn point so you don't need to walk a mile back to the boss that killed you.  That by itself makes the game much less stressful but still being hard.  This time around it is not hard for the sake of it.  It has great exploration and great map design,  there is a surprise in every corner.  Highly recommended to Souls fans.",0,2

But I'm still having a blast exploring and attempting the many many optional bosses the game has to offer. The world is HUGE and it's all just empty space like a lot of open world games. There's things to find everywhere. Mostly things that want to kill you. One thing I don't really get is the co-op. What would make sense to me is someone wanting help, asking for help, then people answering the call for help. But instead the game is backwards: people have to offer help BEFORE there is someone there that actually wants it.

"Mar 15, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,7,"first of all don't believe the hype and 9s and 10s.

the game is solid but it's basically dark souls 3 open world mod, it's the same old thing, copy and paste enemies, animations, traps, combat and so on. the game feels bland. at least sekiro and bloodborne felt original and new but not elden ring.

technical stat on the series x leaves a lot of room for improvement (performance mode can barely hold stable 50 fps most of the time, there's a lot of lod pop in and so on, quality mode looks slightly better but drops fps to around 45, it's like sekiro on xbox one x all over again.)",0,1
"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,9,"Beautiful open-world, with a lot to discover. The art style is impressive. Combat feels good. The only issue is it's performance across all platforms. An option to cap framerates and a 1440p performance mode would be nice.",0,1
"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,7,"This game is NOT accessible to everyone despite what the paid reviewers have said. I should have known as most content creators are just looking to get paid, not actually be helpful in any way.

I had some experience with From games going in. I did almost beat the base game Dark Souls 3. I did play a bit of Bloodborne. So it’s not like I came in blind or unsuspecting. But watching footage and listening to “reviewers” say this game is accessible gave me hope that maybe this would be a more fun version of the previous titles I played through. Nope. This is just as painful as any other souls game. And what’s worse is I convinced a friend to pick it up thinking that and he had zero experience with these kind of games and basically ally wasted $60.

I’ve put around 30 hours into the game. I’ve over-leveled myself because I just wanted to experience the game and the world in a more casual fashion. I don’t care to be a pro at this game. The open world is fantastic. It’s one of the best open world maps I’ve ever seen. Extremely dense. No place is the same. Packed with stuff to actually find and see. It’s filled with caves and dungeons and open world bosses everywhere. I can’t even count the amount of enemy types. So the world, the combat, the exploration, are all top notch as usual.

But it’s brutal out there. I often find myself dying still in a few shoots to almost anything. Arrows and rocks are buried from across the map from enemies that will destroy you. Trying to get out of combat just to use your map again is tedious. I guess I expected the open world part to be more casual and to have a decent way for leveling but this is not the case. Glitch farming methods are the only real way you can even level in this game and it’s no wonder everyone cheeses them.

Questing is absurd. I understand and accept that this is how From does it. I’m not here to try and change it. But doing quests is insanely confusing, and I just end up watching guides because I don’t want to spend hundreds of hours and multiple play throughs to do them. Many quests can be missed.

Bosses themselves haven’t been too bad depending on play style. But again, I over-leveled with a broken farming method and play a Mage so I’ve got range and a general OPness to me. But even at that you still die in a couple shots if not careful. So anyone who thinks they can over-level to the point of 1 shoting bosses or tanking all their attacks will be let down. I hate when gaming companies do this — lure you into a false sense of being powerful. I think that happens here. Even though you can get more powerful in ER than any other game they’ve made, you won’t really feel it and still die a ton.

I think a 7 is very appropriate for this title. There’s still plenty more to say, both good and bad, but I digress. It’s a good game. It’s not game if the year. It’s not game if the decade. It’s just a really solid game from a really solid developer. It’s just a game that’s not meant for everyone, despite how much I hate that statement and think it’s a terrible one. If your not a Souls player and lover, this game is not a entry to it.",0,1

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"Elden Ring is all of FromSoftware's experience combined into one game with a vast open world to boot. Most open world games while huge are empty, Elden Ring's world is not. It's bright, lively, and enchanting while also being dark, gritty, and terrifying. It becons the player to go out and explore regardless of what challenges may be around each corner. The combat is a deep and intense as ever, with plenty of options for the player to explore and tailor their playstyle. And as always the boss's are as difficult as ever with some boardering on the insane. The sheer creativety of the monstrosities that have been created are jaw-dropping. Thankfully you do not have to face these challenges alone with the online co-op and the new spirit summoning system to ease your troubles on this long journey. The story is interesing but elusive which will require multiple playthroughs to fully squeze the blood from this stone, giving the game even more replay value. I highly recommend giving this game a shot but understand that while it is the most accessible FromSoftware title it is a challenge. You will die. A lot.",0,1

I mean did you see the Erdtree?! . Now some people might get this game and think it will be a little different in terms of difficulty, but no. this is still that classic hard souls experience. but you have way more tools to make the game a little easier. for example, spirit summons. spirit summons are AI you can spawn to help you in boss battles. they don't do a lot of damage but they distract the boss so you can get some hits in. overall  this game is a must-play that I would recommend to any fan of the soul's genre",0,3

For new players this game might be harder to enjoy early on due to its lack of guidance and what can be a frustrating combat system and currency/xp system, if you are unexperienced with souls likes. Elden ring also has a few technical issues, like server issues that will hopefully be cleaned up fairly soon and some texture and occasionally enemy pop in.The open world also has a bit of a lower level of quality compared to the more detailed and interesting legacy dungeons, but none the less the open world is still rich with things to do and find. Sometimes the world can look a little outdated graphically but there are moments that truly do shine. Like when you are standing on top of a tower looking over to see the castle you have just finished fighting a challenging boss in, or the dense forest you escaped moments before. The bosses in elden ring vary from being great to more on the level of filler. Not that they are poorly designed just that you may fight a boss and then a have very similar enemy appear somewhere else that is just considered a slightly stronger foe in your path or multiple similar bosses scattered around the world, which can feel a little repetitive. Overall though the experience, designs of dungeons, enemies, sometimes breathtaking vistas, interesting characters and a very well detailed world and lore.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"A masterpiece based upon a foundation laid by George R.R. Martin, and further developed by director Hidetaka Miyazaki, and the development team, From Software, Elden Ring has captivated me unlike any game has before. The Lands Between consist of beautifully artistic scenery and level design, alluring incentives for exploration, fluid combat, and many diverse, challenging bosses. The narrative is firmly present within the environment yet little is mentioned of it, thus allowing for some extrapolation by the player. The more tense combat encounters are accompanied by Yuka Kitamura's masterful work as a sound designer and composer, which has been developed throughout nearly a decade of work on other similar games by From Software. Though its identity is distinctly its own, Elden Ring nonetheless shares many similarities with its predecessors, the Dark Souls trilogy and Bloodborne, and truly feels like the culmination of From Software's work on them. Of the many video games I have tried throughout the last decade, my experience with Elden Ring is confidently my favorite.

The scale of the world is incredible and immersive. You will become overwhelmed and lost at times, this for me is part of the fun of an RPG.There is a a lot to do and see in Elden Ring and it’s going to keep me entertained for quite sometime it should never be how quickly it takes to get to the end but the journey itself.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,9,"Started playing on the night of the release and im almost 40 hours in, i have seen many reviews and was really hyped for this game. Im a big Fromsoftware fan and the souls series, this game in no different. The game is Insanely big, spend the first 30 hours in the first 3 zones taking my own path doing everything i can find in every zone before taking on the main boss. I have seen the reactions of people having a hard time with the first big boss (margit) which wasn't the case for me after spending the first 20 hours in the first 2 zones i easily defeated margit, and i feel like this is how the game should be tackled, exploring is a big key to succes in this game and if this isn't something you like then this might not be the souls game for you.. the game is massive and to be honest will be sad when my journey ends at the end of the game.

I had a couple of issue's with the horse controls and are wonky at times, the fall height also has its issue's..
FPS issue's on XBSX are horrible some times when its rains the FPS dips belows 30 sometimes, also had some boss fights which weren't ideal at all making dodging a mess some times getting me killed.
This might be an issue because i outleveled the zones and took my sweet time exploring but the game feels alot easier then other titles, bosses seem alot easier. I had a couple of bosses in my 40 hours play through that took me around an hour of trying but that was about it. DS3 took me about 2-3 hours for bosses to finish (sulyvahn)",0,4

To put it simply: if you don’t like dark souls or fromsoftware’s previous titles, stay away from this. It’s more of the same. There is nothing new here, other than an expanded map you can move through freely.Because dozens of games do horseback riding better. Do exploration better. Do map design better (there are no cities, towns, or anything other than ruins here), do leveling better.

"Mar 18, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,7,"Lets start by saying i will not be referring to this game as a masterpiece as that horse has been beaten to death? Elden Ring is a good game, but that's it. Its dated as F! In fact it brought back memories of Dragons Lair for me. Move left - swing sword - move right - back step - swing sword what year is it? The exploration in the game is by far the only reason it gets as high a score from me personally. Its super fun to explore and find new places and enemies to kill but this game is so repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. Boss battles are the same, enemies everywhere are the same. It's a great step in a the right direction but if you're going to open your world map then you got to have a reason to live in it, it has to be an interesting place for me to ROLE PLAY. Not overly difficult if you level up and explore the world for better gear and weapons, but why else would you be playing an RPG. Combat is simple and fair most of the time and by fair i mean if you get hit you get punished, that's what these games are about. Sadly because that mechanic is so old and stale once you master moving and taking small bites you can really own this game. Its good but not as good as some other RPG'S over the years. Like Dragons Lair in the arcades as a kid a lot of people got pissed off the game was so hard and wanted their Quarters back. But if you just learned the patterns to the dungeons the Quarters started to go really far. If people were still buying physical copies of games Elden Ring would have its own pre-owned bin at every location. Solid 7/10",0,1

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"The lowest score I could justify giving this game is an 8, and I believe it is a 10. I knew it was a 10 when I sunk 30 hours in 3 days when I am also juggling work and school. Anything lower than an 8 makes no sense - this is one of the most dense, beautiful, dangerous open worlds ever created. Combat is extremely varied. The exploration is top notch - think BOTW where you keep telling yourself ""ok one more thing then I'll stop playing - let me go to that castle first"" and then end up playing another 2 hours. There is SO much creativity and fun packed in this game it is an absolute must-play. Combat while on your horse is also the best I've ever seen in a game. It is so fun. Unlike the Witcher where it's a nuisance to fight on your horse, here I try to stay on unless I absolutely must get off.

As with any other FromSoft game, however, there is a learning curve where you need to learn how to fight. It does take some patience, but once you get that you cannot roll infinitely or just run in and attack, it gets easier from there. And then you sink into it with all the different weapon and magic options you have as you level up. Infinite builds and playstyles. Cool and funny side quests and characters, and the story is the most prominent it has ever been in an FS game.",0,0

"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,8,"Its hilarious to me that in all the 0s and 1s review this game is getting, they can only complain about the graphics being last gen and lack of cutscenes. Nothing screams GIT GUD more than seeing reviews like this. Im glad fromsoft have stuck to their guns and kept the handholding out of their games as is their tradition.

Now for the fromsoft veterans who havent bought this game yet for whatever reason, know that I am only docking points because the endgame areas and bosses have noticeably bad balance compared to maybe 75% of the game. The 6 hardest bosses in this game have maybe 1 second of openings every 30 seconds which makes the fights insanely long

I also dont like how they have introduced the spirit ash mechanics. Spirit ashes are summons that you can upgrade. There are also NPC summons like in previous games but spirit ashes when upgraded are far stronger. There are 5 legendary ashes which summon spirits that are essentially stronger than your own character when leveled up to the max.

This has caused a lot of elitism and anti elitism since they are considered a mechanic of the game unlike NPC summons. Head over to the reddit page for ER and theres posts every day bashing the veterans who dont like using summons

Obviously you can say ""Just dont use them""

The issue is again those 6 hardest bosses and their balance showing. If you use the ashes the fights are a minute long. If you dont, a successful attempt can be up to 8 minutes with these endgame bosses!",0,0

"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,8,"does a good job as a exploration game, but:
- savegame bugs took like 10h of effort, boss killing and farming and weapon and material grinding from me. how does a souls game fail at saving, the previous parts were saving at every opportunity. thats the biggest minus from me
- the game has no clear red line, hugeass open world and no clear directions, cryptic introductions ruins the fun and drag the story longer the wrong way
- progression is superslow, if you struggle with your current stats against enemies, you will struggle more in the upcoming regions. monsters get superhard, runes (exp) and smithing materials are very scarce, i wasnt able to get my weapons past +4 after 50h of gameplay. so i used the rapier +8 which you get as a gift after beating some mainstory boss.
-great runes are a great idea but a greater dissapointment. why do we have to use rune arcs to buff them up? i found in all myhours so far 4-5 rune arcs (similar to humanity and embers) in the open world and those expire once you die and you will probably die every 5 mins once.
- effing dragons at some endgame location give 3,5k runes... and you need at lvl60 or so around 25k exp for a level up. and dragons would at that point one shot you with basic attacks. the game is super tough, i dont know why they went with that kind of progression design. this game is supposed to be a challenge, not a parkour and avoid monster simulation
- the trap chests are a nice idea, but can lead anyone who plays without guides into desperation. i for my part hated that idea

+ great enemy variaty
+ great combat gameplay
+ great mounted combat
+ ashes of war and summon noble spirits are a awesome addition to the game
+ awesome looking bosses (which drop almost no usefull weapons or souls which can be turned into weapons)
+ fast travel is also an awesome addition to the game, from any point (except inside traps)
+ the exploration is also awesome, you can explore so many regions thanks to the jump button
+ some regions seriously looked dreamlike, which almost never was the case in any souls game . which mostly has gory stuff and locations",0,0

However, too many people review bombing it seems because they don't understand this game is in its own genre and isn't a Ubisoft open-world hand-holding experience so I'm giving my review a +1 stat boost. This game its hard its unforgiving and not meant to be a shut off your brain and glide through experience. If that's what you are looking for, please please don't let the cool aesthetic of the game make you buy it, it is not for you.

As for the technical issues, I'm on a 120hz VRR capable tv so it all looks fine to me. I am also against those giving the game a zero for something that will be further optimized with upcoming patches so another +1 stat boost in my review.

The open world is deep and rich with so many places, corners, nooks, and crannies to explore. It can be overwhelming but there's no foul in looking through guides online or on youtube.

The combat ranges from challenging to absolutely brutal, but you can run away go in another direction and return when you're stronger and you have more experience with less difficult opponents.

This is my first souls-like and I'm glad I got it, I am enjoying myself but I'm also not capable of binge playing it like others, I feel this will be a game I go into for 1-2 hours a week to slowly grind away at it.

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,8,"I am writing this as a person who has finished the game and done all side quests:
A good game with a high difficulty, although it has the same dark souls format he open world gives it a new feel however i can't help but to think that they couldn't make enough bosses and just ended up re using a lot of their bosses sometimes up to 5 times. The dungeons are fairly boring but necessary to progress a certain npc's quest line which you will want to do considering he gives you incantations(a form of spell). Despite the few crashes i have had it still runs really good, and as for the story the game follows dark souls usual cryptic path of giving you small bits and pieces that you yourself has to piece together. Although the horse is helpful it can be annoying to use because it's not exactly smooth and I have had a bit of an issue with getting of the horse because sometimes the game does not let you and other times you get stuck mid air and die. They do re use a few enemies and concepts from previous dark souls games like the crab, it's really up to you to decide if this is a nice callback/hint to the previous games or if its lazy. The npc's with decently long quest lines are fewer then i originally expected and with bad rewards at the end of there quests however that is my personal opinion, the weapons in this game are very different and a meta has already established in both in pve and pvp. in pve you can just spam scarlet rot on almost every single boss trivializing the game or just use magic because it does way to much damage. In pvp you want to power stance with fast weapons, use a heavy shield and armor or use the blood hounds curved great sword and spam the weapon art. This was my only negative experiences with the game, if all of this sounds fine to you i would highly suggest buying it even at full price",0,0

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,7,"Let me start off by saying the game artistically looks amazing. However the serious lack of details up close is a bit sad. They're something you would see early PS4/XBO days. The quality mode helps a little, but that mode is nearly unplayable, so hard to consider that an option. There also no quest list or journal, no map pin system, no hand holding of any kind which is kind of fun and kind of irritating at the same time. I like some bit of structure, it doesn't need to be Bethesda level of hand holding though. It also had a fun aspect to it when you're not repeating the same attempt for the 12th time. I played some of the other dark souls and blood borne games when I was younger, but didn't play them very long due to the difficulty. Now that I'm in my 30s I don't mind sticking to it longer but without that historical Souls franchise experience, it is very difficult and very frustrating. I've been playing since launch and still haven't beat the first boss. Watch video, gotten advise and still can't get it done. I would have liked to try it coop but ya know it didn't work for days and I still haven't gotten to try it.  From what I've seen, it's really not that dynamic of a coop anyway so I'm weary. Overall the game is fun  ut is very frustrating not just for difficulty but the broken online mode, meh graphical details, lack of basic features, and crazy clunky fighting mechanics.

While this is not that bad considering the character models and some environments look like early ps4 it’s disappointing. Multiplayer could be phenomenal but is bogged down by bad design choices. One example is walls that forces you to disband group at region zones and have your friends try to get to the point where you’re at alone just so you can progress after you get past the wall. Others include mounts and summons not working. These two features are so core to the single player experience that it is baffling that they couldn’t optimize their game enough to have them included.

It looks exactly like it did in all the advertising and network test (if it looked bad to some why did they buy it and then complain about it?)

Anyway I'm a Nintendo guy and I bought my Xbox so I could play this game and am not disappointed. It's also my first souls game since Dark Souls 1  first came out and I'm loving it, lots of dying even to the first enemy but it can be done with some time and practice. It's huge too, 40 hours in and I haven't even gotten out of the first area, too busy exploring and dying and trying to power up as much as possible, the world isn't empty, it just doesn't have a million markers on the map telling you exactly where everything is, you have to go look for it.",0,0

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"I've always been looking forward to Elden Ring, but I was getting a bit worried as we got closer to release as I saw how many people were hyped for it. I was afraid with them going open world, and the apparent mainstream appeal, that it would be Baby Dark Souls.

Well, my fears were unfounded. Going open world didn't impede this game at all, it elevated it. Almost every square inch of this game is beautiful, unique, and most importantly, full of new experiences. I feel actual joy exploring this land, when usually in an open world game I just zero in on the waypoint so I can quickly kill the enemies and finish whatever lame quest I am on.

There have been a few additions to the Souls gameplay, such as a jump button and stealth. I was surprised to see stealth, but after playing a bit I can't really imagine getting around this world without it.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,0,"Oh, boy another buggy triple-A release. I mean I guess it's to be expected that the same slobs at IGN/Mattyplays/Gamespot/Whatculture/etc that spent 2 or 3 years lying to the general public about Cyberpunk couldn't be trusted on this game either, but I like so many others fell for it.

Story is virtually non-existent they were happier than hell to plug George R R Martin's name all over the marketing materials, but I'm not sure what he did. About as much work as he does on his own series I'd surmise, which is NOTHING. You get what amounts to lore dumps on scrolls and flavor text on items passing as a ""story."" There's no major narrative structure.

The ""revolutionary"" open world is hollow, lifeless, and boring. I've seen more intriguing open worlds in PS3 games. Speaking of PS3 games that's basically what you're getting here in the visuals department. I guess the AAA industry is so exhausted from bribing publishers and youtubers to give them good scores they don't even bother with the graphics anymore. Art direction is however stunning, seems to be where they spent most of their time.

Gameplay is seriously bogged down by numerous bugs and technical issues. Frame rate drops, save crashing, stuttering, janky animations, clipping errors, you name it this game has it. I guess all the 10/10 reviews are based on where the game will be in 2 years once they fix the bugs? That's some optimism for you!

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"Believe the hype. I’ve gone through and read negative reviews on this platform describing frame stuttering, crashing, input lag, what have you. In my 30 hours I’ve not had the game crash once nor frame rate stuttering, especially when a lot of mobs are on screen. It’s impressive to me how the game holds up in these moments of high stress. The art style is gorgeous. It is clear fromsoft put time and effort into this creation. Everything is placed in the world and has a reason for being there. It is incredible to me that they were able to create this in just over 2 years of development. This is also the most accessible soulsborne game, while also being one of the most challenging I’ve played. Keep in mind my review is solely based on my experience in my 30 hours, yes I am a fromsoft fan, so I’ve tried to avoid bias in this review, and I’ve taken off the rose colored glasses to fully experience these opening hours.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,9,"Honestly, first I must say that if you aren't a fan of Dark Souls and/or any previous FromSoftware game this is not going to change your mind.

With that out of the way, let's get down to it. This game is ""bare"" because it wants to give you a sense of exploration. Yes, minimaps are cool, yes quest trackers are good to have, but where's the mystery if every single thing has big arrows pointed at them? The lore is there for people that want to search, but you really have to do some digging to figure things out. Though to be fair the story is not anything different, it's been the same in all games. You're some kind of chosen one that keeps coming back to life and you have to kill some gods to become the next ruler. Good enough for me let's go kick some ass, but there's still a huge world to explore, with plenty of side dungeons/bosses if you want to take a break from the main path.

Which leads to combat, which has always been the best thing in all of the FromSoftware games. The amount of builds you can create is insane, and with new features and mechanics you can pretty much make any build viable. Want do smash things with giant hammers or swords? Go for it. Want to slice and dice with knives and daggers? Take a stab at it. Wanna stand far away and blast enemies with fireballs and magic missiles? Cast away your doubts and blast away your foes. Hell there's even a video of someone playing as Darth Maul, double-blading every enemy in their path.

The visuals are decent, nothing mind blowing but in this day and age it's really hard to improve upon graphics. Even still, the art direction and style carry the game tenfold, so while the graphics aren't amazing you will still be in awe at how great the world looks. I'm constantly panning the camera 360 degrees just to take in all the visuals and I am constantly in awe of it all.

Now to answer the biggest question on everybody's mind: how difficult is it? You really want to know? It's brutal. Maddening. It will make you rage with anger and weep with sorrow. You will cry for mommy and dial 911 for emergency help simultaneously. Your anus will hurt from the relentless 24/7 pounding it gives you. You will fail more than you succeed, but when you do succeed, and rest assured you will, you will feel like the god you are aiming to by the end of the game. But wait, there's more. Tired of getting your ass handed to you for the millionth time? FRET NOT YOUNG TARNISHED! You can summon other players to assist you with bosses meaning you don't have to worry about being stuck for too long.

Overall the game is definitely a blast. I'm playing on the Xbox One X and I have not run into too many technical issues. Yes some FPS drops here and there but no crashing and no fight hindering slow downs during bosses either. The only reason it's a not a 10/10 is because the story is basically rehashed. Well, that and for a game to deserve a 10 it really does need to be superb while also bringing something new to the table. Elden Ring doesn't exactly bring anything new to the table but it definitely improves on the old formula. It's kinda like if your favorite drink is Mountain Dew and your favorite fruit is cherry and they just released Code Red. Except it can kill you twice before you even take your first sip. Yeah, something like that.",0,0

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"While I'm some ways off of creating my video review or even completing the game, Elden Ring has proven itself worth the hype, and despite it being my most anticipated game ever, it still somehow managed to exceed my expectations. Having spent more than 60 hours on the game, I can't put the game down, and I can't wait to get into NG+.

The game is brutal on mistakes, but stick it out, because this is in my honest opinion the greatest game I have ever had the privilege of playing.

There is an actual sense of adventure. The map does not shout at you with dozens of markers - you see something on the map resembling ruins, and you check it out because the game taps into your curiosity. Every discovery you make feels like your own and is rarely guided, with dialogue and world design that compliments the intelligence of the player, as is a staple in FromSoftware's games.

Having spent that much time in the game, I'd say I'm more or less about 60% of the way through, and I am so happy about that. I never want this game to end.

RECOMMENDATION: As I have always said for FromSoft games - your first playthrough should be solo, and unguided. This game is the pinnacle of that statement. Knowing where everything is from guides kills the exploration and discovery aspect of the game somewhat.",0,0

I am yet to complete this game, and an amendment with a 10/10 rating isn’t out of question.

(Far cry 6 or Ac Valhalla as example)Like Zelda Botw, Elden Ring goes against this grain in that it respects the players intelligence to create their own adventure out of the sandbox world that is given. Combat while bring very similar to Dark Souls 3, is the most refined combat that we’ve seen from FromSoftware. Graphics can be seen as a weak point of this game, in that even in next gen consoles it doesn’t seem to give that wow factor as much as other games that are coming out in 2022 such as Horizon Forbidden West. Though I will say the world design of this game is so strong that it outshines the (can be) poor textures. As any Other Soulslike FromSoftware game that  they’ve published, Elden Ring has Excellent Replay Value, the combat has a mastery to it as soon as you begin playing the game.It being a well executed RPG it gives the player so much variations in how they can play the game that by the time you’re finished your 1st play through, you want to begin your second journey straight away just so you experience the game as a different build instead.Elden Ring is must play",0,0

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,9,"Sin duda alguna es la mejor obra de From.Llevo aproximadamente unas 20-30 horas de juego y encuentro varias de las nuevas mecánicas sumamente entretenidas.Dentro de las innovaciónes, la que más me llamó la atención es la de aplicar cenizas/artes de guerra a el arma que quieras y hacer que mejoren de la forma que desees, esto abre la posibilidad de builds híbridas que anteriormente eran imposibles.Por ejemplo:Mi personaje es mago de combate pero en algunas ocasiones me encuentro con enemigos resistentes a la magia o que simplemente reciben muy poco daño, por lo tanto, requiero de un poco de daño divino, eléctrico, de fuego o un poco de buffs como curación o juramento sagrado.Otra mecánica que disfruto mucho es la de contraataque, esto permite a jugadores oxidados o nuevos asestar golpes de alto daño sin requerir mucha habilidad y sin exponerse tanto al enemigo.El sistema de mundo abierto permite una exploración sumamente amplia, así como sorpresas inesperadas como los subterráneos.Pero... Como todo lo bueno, también hay algunas cosas malas.Entre los detalles que me parecieron algo..... Desepcionantes, está la cantidad de material reciclado, entre esto se encuentran las animaciones.Diablillos/esclavos de lothrick.Avatares del arbol/Demonio del refugio.Caballeros superiores/caballeros de lothrick.""gordos de machete"" /legionarios de harald y juso el borracho.Gargolas/Gárgolas de morne.Aliento diagonal de los dragones/aliento de fuego de midir.Basiliscos/basiliscos. Cangrejo/cangrejo. Un jefe en la aldea de los alvinos/demonio de Aries..... Por favor, incluso pusieron los perros :v. También encontré algunas estructuras (chozas y cabañas) que literalmente fueron copiadas de la hoguera de asentamiento de los no muertos. Por último, las mazmorras básicas como minas y criptas tienden a ser un poco repetitivas variando únicamente en la disposición de enemigos, nivel y algunas secciones de las mismas, siento que pudieron haber hecho un diseño único para todas y cada una de ellas. Como conclusión: el juego es extremadamente bueno, presenta varios desafíos justos y sobre todo, es divertido explorar y progresar a lo largo del mundo.

Well let's begin with all the 10/10 reviews. I do believe it is a amazing game, and I really enjoy it, but it has its flaws.

Network code: not much improvement from dark souls 3 and in general, online is a bit hard to get into. Had one item activated that should summon me into other people their world when they got invaded but never happened.

PC build/stable FPS: It is From Software their first open world and mistakes will be made. Where I didn't have too bad of a FPS drop on pc, I know others did. And I sure had some awful frame drops myself during certain fights. In the end, it will be patched out rather sooner then later so I do not feel like it is too far of a point to judge on.

Open world: Their first open world and they nailed it. The moment you step out of the introduction area, you can go wherever you wish to go in a stunning looking world. Walk around and stumble upon a cave? Well it has some neat loot in it and worth a grab. By far the best open world game for me.

Difficulty: The game can be as difficult or easy as you make it. The first boss people seem to be having issues with is Margrit, who is indeed difficult. But it teaches you to do something else. Go out and explore, level up, get stronger weapons and then return to properly fight him.

Everything together, it is a solid 8 out of 10 for me. Not everything is perfect, but which game is? A true love letter to the fans of the dark souls series.",0,0

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"I'm not going to lie to you, it's pretty hard. The game lacks difficulty options, forcing players to either rise to the occasion and enjoy the rigor of fights where you dodge attack after attack performed by colossal bosses, or get mad because they can't manage to time their rolls and write a bad review on metacritic. That being said, the game does feel a bit grindy in the beginning, especially if giants scare you. It also lacks a simple main story, opting instead to give detail and plenty of backstory to its npc's and the world itself and making you the player figure things out. Your destiny won't be found nested in dialogue options, lengthy cutscenes, and a clear-cut path, it'll be what you make it. If you're up for the challenge, get Elden Ring and enjoy one of the greatest games out there.",0,0

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"It’s funny to see people who clearly haven’t played anything more challenging than mainstream bait titles zelda botw, ghost of tsushima, assassin’s creed and whatnot, complain about a game that has a 10+ year long history of having the same solid mechanics set in stone. They don’t realize that the difficulty of these games comes from THEM being a **** player because they were seasoned with the titles stated above, titles that reward you for being a **** player. They are not used to challenges. They want quest markers, dungeon markers, npc markers on the map. They want a difficulty setting. They don’t get what “roleplaying” means in these games. You’re not playing as some killing machine that can crush every single enemy as if they were tin cans, you’re playing as a person who seeks to be that strong one day, and you DO become that strong come late game. I hate that this game became a mountain of hype. Sorry but, the souls series doesn’t deserve this treatment. I don’t know why they decided to open it up to the general, more stupid audience. If this game had the same fanbase DS3 had at its release, I guarantee you it would’ve had a fan review score of 98-99. This game is literally the closest game we’ve had to perfect in its respective genre. Sorry for the long comment, I just felt like they didn’t do justice to this masterpiece of a video game franchise.",0,0

There is so much to do and so much to explore. The game is tough but it gives you multiple ways to come back and to level up. You can even summon spirits, NPCs or other online players to help you through an area or boss. A big thing to note going in is you are going to die, and die alotttttt. Be prepared don’t throw your control; try not to rage quit. Just leave go level up or explore. This game is beautiful and is full of life. Highly recommend.

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"Absolutely amazing, a real breath of fresh air after a year or so of generally disappointing games.A lot of the lower rated reviews are people crying about the difficulty, but to be fair, is the game difficult? Yes, extremely at times, especially if you aren't  familiar with souls style combat, like I wasn't. So if you're not very patient then this isn't the game for you.However, if you commit a little bit of time to learning the combat system and to understanding the bosses move sets, you'll be recorded with what I consider to be one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a very long time.The boss battles are some of the most intricately designed, punishing button mashing and forcing you to beat them, not by luck, but by skill and determination. The scenery is beautiful and the open world is very, very detailed, with a trip into an unassuming shack taking you on a quest spanning multiple hours. The enemies are diverse and always keep you on your toes and every battle is a little bit different. The game allows you to play in a multitude of ways, in a very non-linear style of story telling where you have to figure things out on your own. This makes the game very rewarding and finally beating a boss which you've been beaten by 50 or so times brings unmatched satisfaction.",0,0
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"Definitivamente la evolucion perfecta de los juegos de From Software, en donde literalmente te puedes introducir en un mundo con miles de cosas por descubrir y colocadas estrategicamente para que tengan sentido. Si bien la nueva mecanica de andar a caballo no me termina de convencer, es sin duda, un reto mas a nuestras habilidades frente al mando.

Realmente si piensan que es un Dark souls 4 (lo cual muchas personas lo describen asi) por algunos sonidos, animaciones, npc's y entre tantas cosas. Esto es sin duda lo caracteristico de los juegos de From Software, podemos verlo en juegos como BloodBorne o Sekiro.

La dificultad es una de esas cosas que hacen que From Software sea lo que es hoy en dia y por lo cual la comunidad se mantiene tan fiel a este tipo de aventuras.

Sin duda la joya de la corona de los mundos abiertos. Jefes increibles, materiales interesantes, mecanicas fabulosas y excelente soundtrack.

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,1,"I’ve never been fan of Dark Souls series. I find them too difficult, unfair and frustrating to begin with. Despite that I read some of the review of Elden Ring and hoped for an epic RPG that is more accessible than Dark Souls.

After 6 hours of played I’m pretty much done with this game. The game is still too frustrating and for a casual gamer for me there just isn’t enough help to get started with this game. The combat is absolutely fluent gotta say that but it’s still too challenging and even though I’ve managed to fell some of the bosses there hasn’t been any rewarding moments. The plot is too mysterious and complex to follow and the game hasn’t given any ”wow”-moments to actually get the player hooked into the game.

I gave it a chance but I’m sad to say it still has all the frustrating sides of From Software and Dark Souls games and this pretty much ruins the game. This was not the worst 69 euros spent but definitely comes to top 3.",0,0
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,3,"To start with, this game probably deserves higher than the rating I am giving it but in the light of biased rave reviews the game has received (which would not be accepted by those reviewers unfortunately), I will also provide a biased review according to me personal taste.

Elden Ring is a dated looking poorly optimized game with interesting and fleshed out character build and combat mechanics that only seems to serve the niche of gamers who like the soulslike formula. I believe this game having a rave metacritic would falsely give the impression that it's appealing for masses of casual gamers hence my review.

As a fan of open world RPG genre carrying many other responsibilities which obliges me to not be able to spare extended stretches of time or entirety of my intellectual capacity to a video game, I found this game to be a poor experience.

There are a few critical points Elden Ring ignores whether it's intentional or not. Game experience is very unguided. You will likely have bad time figuring out how to progress the story or even what the story is, and consequently you will find yourself wandering around weak mobs in a monotone routine if you don't enjoy that kind of tedious exploration. World is quiet desolate and falls into pitfalls Ubisoft RPGs are prevalently considered to fall into while having no cities or areas bustling with energy many other RPGs offer.

Accessibility is very poor. Bosses are quiet challenging to the extent that even an experienced gamer who just doesn't have experience with genre will have nightmare time unless one enjoys attempting a single boss fight for more than a dozen time especially given that there are often no tooltips or guidance on how to make certain fights easier given lack of difficulty options for user to choose. This often requires player to memorize move set of the boss while dying numerous times where poor optimization causes big problems as frame drops hinder the application of this memorization as well. This is in addition to the fact that game requires almost impeccable gaming reflexes to apply any of the move set memorization to an efficient enough degree to win these fights.

Overall, I can see the attraction of this game for the fans of this genre but it is not a game that deserves the acclaim reserved for experiences that can be enjoyed by majority of the overall open world RPG genre like the Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2 do deserve.",0,0

"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"After more than 50 hours I'm writing my review of Elden Ring. In my eyes, the game deserves a 10/10 from a Dark Souls fan perspective. About the performance itself. I play it on my XSX in 2K and the 60 fps is stable for me. Only in 4k mode it fluctuates between 45/50-60 fps. Also online works for me from 1 day without problems. It has not worked for many people who came later on the release day because the server capacities were at capacity. From Software probably didn't expect so many players, which of course doesn't excuse it at all. However, it must also be said that this has now been fixed.Graphically, the game is no Horizon Forbidden West, which was never expected. It is a beautiful Dark Souls game.I read a lot of negative reviews here that classify the game as too hard and only got it because of the open world. If you haven't played a Souls game yet, I think you should do so first. For anyone who says it was only rated well by Souls fans, YES BECAUSE IT IS A SOULS GAME. I don't understand the negative review because the game is like Dark Souls, that's what it's supposed to be and I thank From Software for that too. From Software has not only kept its own game concept, they have also improved a lot of the negative things that bothered me about Dark Souls.This is not a generic mainstream sony open world game. Anyone who thinks they are getting a standard Sony open world game like Horizon, Days Gone, etc should stay away from Elden Ring.Anyone who is a fan of the Dark Souls series and especially the first part, this game is a must! Elden Ring is a masterpiece from From Software. They have managed to take the best of their last games and combine it with an incredibly large open world. The game has the atmosphere of Dark Souls 1 (to the point that I feel like I did the very first run of Dark Souls 1, both nostalgia and the childlike joy of exploring an unknown world), it has the movement of Dark Souls with nuances of Sekiro.The open world seems nice but a bit empty and the first dungeons very  (that's how I felt)  , the Souls feeling did not come up immediately. BUT! After 50 hours of playing I understand why this was so at the beginning. The game should go in the mainstream direction whereby newcomers should settle into the game concept in the first area. After the first boss and the first castle, the Souls feeling really kicks in and content is thrown at you. So many different beautiful worlds, secret paths, interesting quests and many many random surprises on his journey there has never been in a Souls game.I haven't played a game that captivated me like this in years.",0,0
"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"Only issue I have with this game is the occasional performance issues or frame drops but it happens so infrequently that it barely takes away from the overall experience.
Jaw dropping visuals, incredibly rich and deep lore, gameplay is the best the souls series has seen and the bosses are some of the most impressive ever in gaming period.
I sometimes died because of how cool, badass or beautiful some of the bosses were and it distracted me from dodging the brutal attacks.
This is an open world done right, not just ticking off a checklist of things all generic open world tropes but it an actual well polished and thought out world, everything in it feels like it belongs and it feels so full of life and variety that after 70hours + of playing I'm still finding surprises and I see any sign of that stopping.
FromSoftware have out done themselves and I believe this game will have a spot among one of the greatest games ever made and has a new stepping stone of what an open world can bring pushing the genre forward but also the gaming industry as a whole.
The bar has been raised so high and after writing this review I'm gonna go play Elden Ring some more.

"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,8,"Don't listen to the cult, be fully warry of the game you are about to buy. I have fully enjoyed the game but I'm about half way through and frankly, I'm burned out it's just too repetitive.

The Critics reviews for this game, are insane. Have they lost their **** minds? This game is the definition of quantity over quality.

Why is this game immune to basic critiques other games get ROASTED for? Its open world...is bad. Pure and simple. It's big? it's open? But it's 2022 and EVERY open world has to be more than just open and big. The level design is crude and linear. Choice in design amounts to ""path with traps"" or ""path with no traps"". To much of dungeons is walking on basic rooftops with no level design whatsoever on them. It's lazy. They should have cut the game in half and focused. Dungeons and villages are copy-paste, traps are crude, there is just too much yet so little outside of the combat.

Which would be fine, if the game weren't acting like it was anything more than just combat.

I honestly do really enjoy this game's gameplay, but for 2022...it's pretty subpar as far as diversity of offerings and complexity of systems. I've gotten about 1/2 the way through (I've done most everything up to entering the Capital and I'm level 90ish) and I'm pretty much burned out. The story, frankly, is just lore...that's it. You've got 1 real story going on and the rest is just set dressing to explain gameplay choices that were already present in Dark Souls...aka, it's not story. There is nothing compelling here. It's just beautiful metaphorical imagery that amounts to pretty much nothing narratively other than a loose allegory for life that's so vague and lacking in substance that it's just boring. They stole the death rune? Neat...what does that mean? That we can revive...that's it. The entire plot is just telling you why you are playing a dark souls game.

At what point does ""mysterious"" end up just being ""vague and empty""...because my experience has been thinking something was coming, and being disappointed OVER and OVER.

I don't want quest logs or map icons telling me where to go, but this game won't even give you enough story context to tell you the next step in a quest. They just give you a dagger and say ""give it to the person who owns it""...like what the actual ???? It's like they forgot to finish the game. I have spent a vast swathe of time playing this game, doing nothing but looking up the next step because the game gave me NOTHING and I'm not gonna waste my time searching for a needle in a haystack.

I LOVE solving puzzles, I love piecing together information, I love open story design...my favorite game of all time is Outer Wilds. This game, just frankly sucks outside of the combat (which is still dated)...deeply. The horse controls are pretty mediocre and lack in clarity, bosses are all dodge spam and lack interesting mechanics (I can name like 3 bosses that actually felt neat but 1 of them was so bad at the same time I don't even want to mention him).

I am TOTALLY FINE with how hard this game is...if anything it's the easiest dark souls ever. It's just only a dark souls game.

I do think, for a Souls gamer...this game is gunna be a 10/10...don't hesitate. Buy it.

But for me, a person who has played this kind of game before...I'm just not interested in more of the same.

Being conservative, not pushing your game franchise to be more, that's not something that should be rewarded with the amount of praise this game is getting...there is SO MUCH this game franchise could do to bring out greater gameplay complexity while maintaining its unique stamp. Being open world isn't revolutionary. Not having basic UI elements isn't revolutionary. Telling a vague story badly isn't compelling. These are problems.

This game is deeply overhyped...period. But so are many games, such as BOTW...which was also great in many categories while mediocre in others. However, BOTW was actually innovative. It took risks. This game is a singleplayer MMO from 2004 with better combat. Thats how crude it feels to engage with the world and story and level design. That has to count for SOMETHING in the score.

So I'm sorry but I have to dock this game...it's not perfect, it lacks so much. In a RPG game market that is deeply more complex than this title I don't really see what it is doing so right that it warrants a 10/10...it's just doing so little and pumping out a lot...so that's all games have to be now? That's just what AC is doing and everyone docks AC?...and I like this more than AC...but how is this game dodging the basic criticism the industry applies to every other similar title?

Sifu and Hades has done more to move the Dark Souls formula forward than FromSoft has...it's bad. This isn't the next BOTW, this is just another Dark Souls title. Don't be deluded by the hype",0,0

I hated dark souls, played it for 5 hours and quit when it came out. This has just the right amount of difficulty. For those complaining I am sorry I said what I said but get good, or go on YouTube and figure out how to become a badass in the world.

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,9,"I’m convinced that these low user reviews haven’t even played the game. Soulless? Uninspired? Bad graphics? None of these things have been an issue for me. Sure the graphics aren’t AAA level, but the art direction more than makes up for that. I haven’t entered a world that has more character to it since Skyrim. This game is brilliant, and is greater than the sum of its parts. Especially weird are the reviews saying “Forbidden West is better”??? This is not a flawless game, but it is still an amazing one. If you give it a chance and have the patience to learn from dying instead of getting angry, then please don’t let the negative user scores throw you off. If you can’t handle dying or don’t like overcoming adversity, then don’t play it.

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,10,"As a long time fan of Fromsoft's Dark Souls trilogy, Elden Ring takes the cake as the best of them all. I'm naturally a skeptical person and don't go throwing around the phrase ""the best"" too often. They plucked and dropped some of the best features from all of their past games and beautifully orchestrated them together with an interesting original story and produced a masterpiece. The music in ER is amazing as well and deserves recognition. There are a lot of reviews on here, and all over the internet, that make ER sound like the worst game ever made. A minute sum of these reviews and comments are valid and bring up reasonable points. However, a majority of them are emotionally motivated and charged by the overwhelming popularity this game has imbued.

The thing that differentiates this from most other open world games is that the devs of other games want to show you their work, but from wants you to discover it.

I wish I could post images here. The early game bosses are way harder compared to Dark Souls 3’s early game bosses. Gameplay-wise, it’s mostly like the previous FromSoftware titles.

It's probably the best game I've ever played and I have already over 100 hours.The gameflow, gameplay, combat is perfection. They took the best from all souls games and created a magnum opus in terms of combat.The enemys/bosses and areas are so amazing and detailed that I am still stunned when I look at it.Cinematics are awesome and it has so much good content, that it blew my mind.The quests and story is also wonderful and I was never more into a game as Elden Ring overall. Definetely a 10/10.Now lets talk about the current ""controvery"":Some Game devs (Especially the sore loosers at ubisoft) badmouthed this game with various untrue reasons like: missing UI, bad graphics, overhyped by game critics and so on (,while being unable to make good games theirself).Saddest part is, that some ubi-fanboys are reviewbombing this game and giving their favourite ""open world game"" perfect score. They usually copy ubisofts and over devs words and just add the ""bad performance"" part for PC, which mostly has been fixed for people above min. reqiurements.If you don't like it or even hate the game, I guess it's okay if you give like a 5. But it shouldn't be objectively possible to give below 5 because it's in every aspect amazing. Now to all the Fanboys/Clowns: If you really hate it, it's okay. Taste is objective.If you think the game is bad because of gameplay or graphics then you didn't know what game you bought in the first place and you are a fool.If the game doesn't run smoothly, next time read the System requirements, which they posted like 1 week even before release.If you cry about UI, lore or just copy the stupid/false words from the ""devs"", just go to your corner and play your easy/boring/bad microtransaction games with 800 questmarker/waypoints on the map where you just follow a path like a bot without thinking/playing yourself. If that's the case, you are the reason why gaming gets bad and gives money to those big ""triple A"" companys, who exploit clowns like you.If you want to fight me in an argument about this, just add me on steam or write me a comment there.

The UI takes some getting used to but is NOT the garbage that has spewed out of the mouths of prominent developers of other game franchises. (Ubisoft and Guerilla could definitely learn something from this) Story wise it's minimalistic but well done and unique. My medieval fantasy cup of tea. Control wise it's really a matter of understanding the mechanics. If you're not used to souls like mechanics the controls are going to seem poor to you. The graphics are top notch particularly on quality mode. Performance wise...I'm really dissatisfied with it on my Series X. My hope is that FromSoftware steps up to the plate to remedy this.

"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,xbox-series-x,8,"El juego es excelente y para ver lo bueno hay miles de review el tema es lo malo y que no lo hace un 10/10 y a mi criterio es, en la exploración muchas veces el objeto a descubrir es un pedazo de planta que no sirve para nada, o un hongo, debieran de haber incluido en estas zonas más materiales de mejora de armas, ya que  es un problema la escasez de los mismos, debido a que por lo general uno va a empezar a mejorar un arma de arranque de la partida y la verdad q no hay forma de saber si el arma encontrada a las 60hs de estar jugando va a escalar mejor o peor que la que tenemos equipada, por lo tanto van quedando relegadas al inventario de a decenas y solo usaremos 4 o 5 en toda la partida, quizás hubiera sido mejor resumir el juego a 12 armas como lo hizo bloodborne. Otro punto negativo son las quest secundarias, en estas si hubiera hecho falta algún tipo de indicador o un guiño del personaje de donde encontrarlo la próxima vez o de que hacer, por que literal es imposible completarlas sin mirar una guía, lo cual le quita al juego ese extra de andar a ciegas y lo convierte en algo monótono el tener q ver una guía, volver al juego ir a ese punto x tener un dialogo, volver a la guía, ver el siguiente paso, volver al juego, hacerlo..... arruina la experiencia. Fuera de eso es un excelente juego y la realidad por ahora es que la dificultad está presente al inicio, una vez alcanzado el nivel 60  con tu arma favorita en +17 algún stat de fuerza o destreza en 40  y unas cenizas de invocación  en +6 la dificultad baja al 50%. Por ejemplo arranque el juego como  es esperado y en lugar de ir a la segunda y tercera zona, me fui para la cuarta el desafío era alto pero la fue peleando y lo completo hasta donde se podía, y luego al ir a las zonas que en realidad eran la 2 y 3, me la estoy pasando matando a enemigos poderosos de 4 golpes   .para resumir tiene una duración monstruosa ya que explorando al 100% y jugando sin guías a la primera recurrendo luego a ellas para sacar el 100 de lo que ofrece cada una de las zonas, con quest incluidas, llevo unas 60 hs y calculo que recién un 50% del juego, y aun sigo enganchado cosa que no me paso con otro mundo abierto",0,0

The first 60-70% or so of the game is a ton of fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. But the boss design, especially in late game is just... mindbogglingly bad. I won't put specifics in here so as to avoid spoilers, but I was feeling so bummed about the state of this game that I created an account here to write this review.

I looked forward to this game for years, but the late game bosses just make it completely unenjoyable. It feels like beating them has nothing to do with skill or learning, but just dumb luck. It feels like From needs to recalibrate their expectations for boss design. I'll probably just play the first 70% of the game or so going forward, but I'm not even sure if I'll stick around for that.

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Where do I begin on this title and the insanely inflated hype around it? Elden Ring is yet another entry to the Souls genre, and this time steps away from the tried and true design of tightly crafted game worlds that Fromsoft usually brings us. Unfortunately, we are left with a bland and lifeless Overworld, connected with obscured dungeons that feel copied straight from Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons. There was something missed in translation here, as most open worlds draw you in with a plethora of things to experience, not just empty space between the next thing to kill.
Speaking of killing, the entire game revolves around removing enemies out of your way. This is the same as every Souls game, but this is supposed to be an open world experience. Imagine just laying a linear game out on top of a big map and calling it ""open world"" now. With nothing else to do, you will be traveling across large, empty expanses to find another repetitive dungeon, another rehashed enemy, another reskinned boss...with rewards that do not give you incentive to explore. You hit walls where you cannot pass, so you must go try a different route until you are strong enough to do the ""intended"" route. You will begin to lose steam after the honeymoon phase wears off.

The bosses get progressively more ridiculous as you move through the game. Instead of opting for a dance of combat like Bloodborne or Sekiro, you will spend the entire battle rolling around, counting on iframes to help scrape you out of a 9-hit combo alive, where each hit of the combo can chunk you for most of your health. Enemies everywhere rely on delay attacks, holding their weapons in the air just until you finish rolling for a cheap kill. Some will defy physics and spin midair to land on you. The whole thing is about being cheesed by enemies or cheesing them by leveling. Even having the strongest physical defense armor in the entire game, plus dumping most of your points into Vigor, you will still be 2 shot by end bosses. Highly disappointing.

The ""open world"" is rife with shambling creatures that walk in circles or wait patiently for you to approach and dispatch them.  NPC stand around, lifeless in this uninspired world. You cannot track any quests, so unless you have a really good memory, you are expected to play with a journal by your side for notes. The UI used is ugly and over a decade old. Movement is nearly a direct copy from Dark Souls 3, with weapon Arts.

The biggest crime here, though, is the reviews from Critics. Unanimously overflowing 10/10 review from nearly every gaming company out there. For a continuation of pretty niche type of game, the how is unreal. Especially when NOTHING here is revolutionary, inventive, or deserving of the word ""masterpiece."" At best it is bait to get people to buy Elden Ring, only to be highly disappointed after the refund return window has closed.

Lastly, the hype of George RR Martin to sell the game! This is just using a name to sell your product. You can replace entire words with phrases from Dark Souls. Point of Lost Grace = Bonfire.

Watch reviews (not 10/10 ""critic"" reviews, but actual USER reviews), check out some gameplay. Read reddit posts that are not biased towards it being great. Don't just jump on a train taking gaming in the wrong direction.",54,89

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Definetly the worst game from the soul series, as it even gets to be called a ""soul series game"" even though it pretends (or was marketed pretending to) be something new and different. It is not. The game is a poor mixture of Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne and Sekiro. It's absolutely generic, as it copies infinite secondary and mini-bosses from the previous games. The game is an eternal liop in a poor open word, boring and repetitive, with no plot (contrary to what was sold, using the name of George R. R. Martin). After all that, graphics were far better on Demon Souls. Even still, the game struggles to load scenarios, hardly runs smooth on 60 fps using the performance mode and has a lot of issues. For example, I had one boss, wich was so generic I can't remind his name, being sanding still at his final 10% of life waiting for me to put him out of misery (wich was probably being a part of this game). Never seen such an overrated game. I only recomend it if you are in for some dark souls copied gameplay, wich may be fun. Don't expect more than that.",34,59

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Calling this game a must play is just wrong. The overall critic rating is a result of about 50 hardcore souls-fans that are willing to ignore many, many issues and only focus on the thrill of endless boss fights (admittedly - definitely thrilling). But this game is so far from perfect.

In terms of visuals and performance - it is very far from next gen. The animations, the frame rate, the pop-in. The world almost never responds to the player. I like the art style but next to games like Guardians or the Galaxy or Horizon ll it looks like a sharper PS4 game at best.

Some weapons are good but the overall combat system is unbalanced. Story is told in very lazy way but no one cares about that.

Enemy design (especially bosses of course) is often brilliant and the music is fantastic. The open world is fun to explore but to stay it's revolutionary is far from the truth imo.

The only things that makes this game so exciting is chemistry in your brain. The thrill of defeating a giant boss is amazing, and the hard, fixed difficulty is what makes every encounter so intense. Same for exploration and the sense of constant danger.

It's no wonder that From Software refused to add an easy mode. Without the sense of accomplishment after beating a boss, without the constant fear and sense of danger, this game has almost nothing to offer, and it's definitely not a next-gen, must play title.",94,173

Incredible AI is also lost with NPCs and some bosses. The gameplay remains solid and clean. The last downside and perhaps the worst is the total recycling of assets as if it were a copy and paste.

While the open world can be visually interesting from a aesthetic point of view at times, the open world can feel boring, empty lots of space and no real incentive to fight a lot of the monsters. So the BOTW comparisons is laughable and Skyrim! lol i cant even... The game isn't bad its just 100% more of the same, don't let these people fool you about the magic of ""discovering the open world""  That this is straight up dark souls 4. same look, same feel same outdated graphics and same gameplay.

The scores for this game are blown way out of proportion. Like I said, it’s a good game but it isn’t great. Exploring is both fun and tedious. I was disappointed with the lack of content in the open world and even more disappointed in the boss fights. Combat is what you would expect from a Souls game but the one-shot deaths and overly-difficult bosses left a really bad taste in my mouth. I think, at this point, FromSoftware has run out of ideas to make their games challenging and rewarding and instead have made Elden Ring tedious and frustrating. What’s good in the game is good. What’s bad and lazy in the game is just plain bad and lazy. With horrible dual boss fights, a lack of content in the world, frustrating enemies, extremely slow character animations (even by Souls standards), confusing map design and cheap deaths, I expected so much more from this game. Overall, you’re left with a decent game that gets boring and tedious very quickly. Magic is definitely the way to go in this game. Approach it similarly to Demon’s Souls.

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,Still the souls games are weak from the narrative telling factor.. the world are fantastic however the game its not for all the gamers.. its too hard.. nice to try but its not a fun experience for the beginners..,55,108
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Let's break into points:
1. A boring repetitive empty giant open world. Generic and recycled bosses and enemies;
2. The same old-style FromSoftware way of telling a story: a boring puzzle that has to be solved through reading hundreds of items descriptions and cryptic conversations with stoned NPCs;
3. Clunky combat system and light-speed bosses from Tekken: rolling through infinite AoE attack combos just to land one or two strikes, repeat;
4. Few pieces of equipment and terrible drop rates. You kill a boss just to receive some useless material;
5. Very beautiful art direction, BUT terrible graphics;
6. Poor performance;
7. Different from Dark Souls, and the others, Elden Ring is mediocre at building tension. Dark Souls is a game that has you always under pressure, theres is little to no rest. You can only feel safe when you're resting at a bonfire. When you play for the first time, you never know what to expect. Enemies are strategically placed, as well as traps. And they're everywhere, all the time. Elden Ring can't do this. There are long pauses to ""commune with nature"", because the big empty open world is not threatening. You can see the enemies from distance, and you're never caught by surprise. The way from Ruin A to Ruin B is safe and sound... And once you approach Ruin B, you know ""ok, now I'll face some challenge"", at this moment, there's no tension, it was ruined by the anticipation. You always know what to expect and when;
8. Multiplayer is the same old song: dependant on consumable items and limited to smoke walls. FS could have delivered a true multiplayer, but they are too addicted to the same old colorful phantoms paradigma.
Am I saying the game is not good? No, I'm not. I'm just convicted that Elden Ring is far from being the  Eight World Wonder that media wants it to be. Way too far from 97 on Metacritic. In my opinion, the worst among it's siblings.",66,130

The controls and action are  smooth, and there are loads of content to keep players exploring while developing and honing the skills to survive in the unforgiven Lands of Between.",128,253
"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"I own both PC and PS5 versions of the game. For PS5 version i will ignore the technical aspects. To call this game Open World RPG will be huge misleading the gamers. It is not a story driven RPG. The ""world"" is not lived in. It is not a meaningful representation of any world setting. Best way to explain what it is a Lovecraftian nightmarish realm with bosses and monsters spread around the map. Only meaningful anchors for a human players are the occasional NPCs that are as vendors. They are incredibly out of place, literally and figuratively. So this cannot be the best Open World RPG game ever, since it is neither a open world nor an RPG game. It is a soul game takes place on a open area/field. It is more like a monster fighting arena game with skill progression. It is not something you can compare to Witcher3 or Skyrim etc. Let's get that part straight first since professional media is misleading players who are not familiar with Soul games.

Defining characteristic of a Soul game is ""extremely hard"" boss fights. And not its story. Not so surprisingly that is also the case here. There is no meaningful story here, there are tons of obscure and non sensical narrative. Part Japanese translation, part source material. Whatever GRR martin has written (if any), clearly developer just tromped on it and what is left is nonsensical garbage.  You will enjoy this game, if primary reason you play the games is challenge and skill progression.

The game is closer to MMOs than single player open world RPGs. You need to farm a lot in this game to give your character a chance to kill next required boss. It has even same MMO raid zoning type setups in the game.

Now i know i sound negative. But in reality game is an addictive and good game. It is more like 7 or 8 out of 10. That is if you like the unique genre this game is. Yes there is something like that. It is called ""Soul like"" games. You die hundreds of times and build the skillset to kill impossibly difficult nightmarish next boss.

Graphics of the game is closer to Oblivion than Skyrim, much worse than Witcher3, or Red Dead Redemption. It runs on old engine. Developer tried to compensate this by adding ""Silmarillion"" style majestic light trees, and that is creating an illusion of fantastic setting. graphics are poor. But artistic style is good, with what is available to them developers created an interesting world. I wish they actually put some stories in there to explain the lore behind it.

Overall it is the best Souls game. but it is no way the best open world RPG where all reviewers are lying about. Be aware before buying. Especially the ones that are not familiar with this genre.

So how did this game got the 10/10 scores from all professional reviewers. It looks like there is a simple answer. Because unlike other games, only the ""soul fanatics"" reviewed this game. Why is that? Because game is so so difficult to play and beat in the given time frame for a preview of 1 week, for most media sites, only the Fans of the Soul like games have committed to the review, and result is magnum opus rating, for a not so magnum opus product.

Now that said, i started to enjoy more and more as i play the game. It is extremely addictive and exploration and character progression aspects are well done. So i am altering my score to 6. I think if you are not uber fan of souls genre, this is more reasonable rating.

Ultimately IMO Elden ring is not an RPG game, it is an Arcade game with similarities to modern MMOs than popular open world RPGs. Its biggest flaw in my mind it does not have a cohesive story, you can finish this entire game and you wouldnt know what the heck it was about. Every human you encounter in this world, save few NPCs are hostile against you. By definition the world is not immersive, it is an arcade battleground with focus on combat and killing bosses.

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,Its ok but that's all it really is. Its DS3 but with more build customization basically. So if you just want the same old Dark Souls but more content you'll be satisfied. But it isn't nearly as innovative as the press and streamers have made it out to be.ConsCombat hasn't taken any steps forward its still L1 Spam or R1 spam no real combos or varied movesets like Nioh has for example. Enviromental collision/obstacles is terrible with enemies reaching through whole walls and pillars as it always has been. Frames drop pretty consitently during combat even on framerate mode. But hopefully that'll be a simple patch here soon.Not enough boss variety to fill the open world. They use many of the bosses 4 or more times throughout a single playthrough. With one of them being Asylum Demon from DS1. I mean come on we already had to fight him 3 times in that one 11 years ago now another 4 in this game?! Poise still sucks. I don't want broken DS1 poise where everyone havels but there really is no point in heavy armor if even hits that do almost no damage can stagger/stun lock.  ProsAtmosphere is the best its been for a souls game.Actually a decent number of NPCs to meet and have minor roles/quests withThe new customizable flask is probably the best part/innovation.Map &amp; fast travel is an extreme improvement but I can't give them major credit for something that's been a feature in other games since 2005 lol.

Me parece un juego terrible en el mal sentido, entiendo que al ser un juego Souls sea difícil pero con Elden Ring a los desarrolladores se les ha ido la mano y no se siente difícil sino más bien injusto. Me explico:

En Elden Ring la dificultad se basa en lo lento, débil y torpe que es tu personaje, mientras que los enemigos son rápidos, fuertes y ¡DIOS MIO! Vaya que aguantan los golpes. Conforme avances podrás ir mejorando poco a poco tus habilidades, para esto necesitaras runas, así que prepárate para farmearlas como loco porque son indispensables, aquí es donde entra la parte ABURRIDA del juego. Algunos jefes son tan fuertes que si no subes tu nivel te será imposible vencerlos y ahí es donde me choca mucho Elden Ring. Tan solo para matar al primer jefe principal, tarde 2 horas y tuve que subir al nivel 23 para lo cual me tarde 7 horas de juego, de esas 7 horas la mitad puedo decir que fueron aburridas, ya que, aunque el mundo de Elden Ring es enorme, tienes que tener mucho cuidado de no morir y perder todas tus runas, entonces no te puedes divertir como quisieras debido a este factor. Al final Elden Ring se basa en: morir, mejora tus habilidades, vuelve a morir, sigue mejorando, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere... Y no porque seas en si un mal jugador, sino porque simplemente el juego es injusto y te CASTIGA por cualquier pequeño error de forma despiadada.

Si tu idea de un juego divertido es la de morir, morir, morir y morir, tardarte de mínimo 2 horas en derrotar a un jefe y pasar largas sesiones de juego farmeando para crecer de nivel, Elden Ring es para ti. Si prefieres un juego retador y que no se sienta TAN injusto te recomiendo mejor acercarte a juegos como Sekiro o Bloodborne. Elden Ring simplemente no vale la pena.",44,94

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,2,"Anyone saying that graphics are not bad or ""there are no graphics issues on PS5 blah blah blah"" is either lying or needs to play other games, than just Souls games. These graphics are worse than any AAA game from 2015/2016. This is NOT something you can make arguments for or argue about. These are simple facts and you can verify them very easily by either playing older games or just checking Youtube videos of these games.

Ironically outdated graphics are not the main issue with this game at all. My god, games in 2015 looked great. GTA 5 on PC that came out April 2015, looks still phenomenally good. So i have zero issues with 2015 graphics, i love 2015 graphics, but not on 2022 games, that should have 2022 graphics. Is this too complicated to understand for fanboys?

But even then, i could play it with these graphics, if actual game itself was good. Sadly it's far, far from good. It's extremely mediocre, world is E M P T Y. There's nothing but empty areas between caves and monster locations and then you find some small ruins here or there. That's the whole map design. That's bad. That's amateur level or map designing.

Story is there, but it's not nearly fun or interesting enough, that i would spend hours learning every boss move sets. I actually liked how bosses looked like (like their look, not how they make combos or whatever, but just how they look like). I think dragons looked way too basic, but some MAIN bosses, looked interesting enough. I almost got this anime vibe, that very first boss already feels like final boss, but actually there's countless of other bosses after him, who are ever stronger, bigger, etc.

Sadly that wasn't enough for me, i wanted this game to be way more complex than just boss killing simulator, i wanted it to be deeper, i wanted it to be actually INTERESTING. I can tolerated difficult bosses, if game itself is interesting enough for me, to want to keep going. But this game doesn't have that. It doesn't have that ""Resident Evil 4"" (2005) vibe where there will be cool story moments after this epic boss fight, etc. There's none of that. If you beat the two bosses in castle, all you get is just another big swamp area full of random generic monsters for you to fight with. Too me that's so boring, so basic and so empty that i just didn't care anymore.

In the end of the day, i will never play this game again, i didn't refund, i simply uninstalled it and went back to play some actually great games to get rid of that ""empty, meaningless"" feeling that Elden Ring left in me. I will never talk about this game again with anyone. I will never recommend this game to anyone and i will try to ignore that it ever existed, because it was that bland.",44,97

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,4,"Geez this is a very overhyped game.  This is really just souls 3 open world.  The main positives are that many of the bigger enemies look really cool and have cool looking animations.  But there are A LOT of negatives.  Graphics look rough at times and do not have many of the polished features that other high profile games have such as good face animation or enviornment responding to what you do, very clunky fighting mechanics and I can't stress that enough, unnecessarily unforgiving boss fights, and many and I mean many reused bosses and enemies from past Souls games littered throughout.  In my opinion it seems the over the top and unbalanced difficulty is put in place to mask the clunky fighting mechanics and big flaws in the game.  Dark souls cultists will love this game and claim everyone who doesn't needs to GG and that they just don't like difficult games, but gamers who are used to other games whether they are very difficult or on the easier side, technical fighting games, and polished open world games will see this game as not designed for them hence the misleading marketing push for this game to try and sell it.  It would be one thing if I had fun playing this but I didn't.  I feel like I wasted my money on an expensive game.  I don't recommend getting this.The fighting mechanics are the biggest disappointment for me because it's not really different.  When comparing the fighting mechanics to say Nioh 2, it was just boring.  Nioh 2 had waay more moves and a waay deeper fight system to perfect in a souls style kind of game.  Why didn't From Software learn from that?  The fighting mechanics alone should make this game not worthy of perfect reviews in light of Nioh 2 even from the cultists. And the reviews and marketing push on this game have really been misleading.  I suspect because they know most people will not enjoy playing this game's highly clunky fighting mechanics, unnecessary and unbalanced difficulty, and being left to deal with no tutorial except the From Software cultists.  Do you want a game that you have to look up how to find or get past anything every step of the way on YouTube? Most people would say I don't might doing that here and there but if the game is reliant on that because of how it was designed or poorly designed then no.  And anyone claiming this is like Breath of the Wild is an idiot.

I mean I guess it's to be expected that the same slobs at IGN/Mattyplays/Gamespot/Whatculture/etc that spent 2 or 3 years lying to the general public about Cyberpunk couldn't be trusted on this game either, but I like so many others fell for it.

Story is virtually non-existent they were happier than hell to plug George R R Martin's name all over the marketing materials, but I'm not sure what he did. About as much work as he does on his own series I'd surmise, which is NOTHING. You get what amounts to lore dumps on scrolls and flavor text on items passing as a ""story."" There's no major narrative structure.

The ""revolutionary"" open world is hollow, lifeless, and boring. I've seen more intriguing open worlds in PS3 games. Speaking of PS3 games that's basically what you're getting here in the visuals department. I guess the AAA industry is so exhausted from bribing publishers and youtubers to give them good scores they don't even bother with the graphics anymore. Art direction is however stunning, seems to be where they spent most of their time.

Gameplay is seriously bogged down by numerous bugs and technical issues. Frame rate drops, save crashing, stuttering, janky animations, clipping errors, you name it this game has it. I guess all the 10/10 reviews are based on where the game will be in 2 years once they fix the bugs? That's some optimism for you!

This is touted as being ""the most accessible Souls game ever"" which may in fact be the case. If it is, it still has a long way to go.

The lack of markers on the map is supposed to ""give you more incentive to explore the world"" when in fact it just makes everything tedious. The lack of a quest log means that you have to manually keep track of any side quests, which is absolutely absurd that a game in 2022 doesn't have a quest log. I honestly can't even think of how that can be construed as a positive.

In terms of graphics, it looks like a late PS3/early PS4 game and it has FPS issues even on PS5. The UI looks like something out of the early 2000s.

As for the story, most of the side quests actually have a better story than the main story, which is kinda sad. You're likely either going to need a second playthrough or some googling to fully grasp the story, which is pretty bad game design. Don't take lessons from Kingdom Hearts when it comes to story.

Melee dex is completely freaking useless I had to farm endlessly as a dex melee character to beat the second boss, I farmed til I was level 50 while he is like a level 20. Meanwhile mages are one shotting bosses. This game is just beyond awful. If you play a melee character you will die endlessly, as every boss and miniboss and strong normal mobs have aoe attack with tracing! Oh and also 80%+ are faster than you. Not to mention theres both input delay and input que take when you dodge roll for instance so the roll happens 0.5 sec later (great design in a reflex game, real genius) and regarding input delay you will die many a time due to your character deciding to do a command 2 commands ago.

Also this games design is just awful, damn awful. Lets compare this awful game to some of my favorite games like take dota 2, (the real hardest game in the world not filled with BS mechanics) and diablo 2. In dota 2 all heroes are free and everyone is at equal footing since everyone can pick everyone. This means that even though you might die to another hero you can just spam that hero from now on and realise his strengths and weaknesses after 10-100 games.

In diablo 2 theres this frustrating mechanic called hit recovery. What it does is it stunlocks you if damage taken exceeds 12% of max life. Now it can be very annoying getting stun locked to death, but this leads me to my point: in diablo 2 the enemys ALSO HAS HIT RECOVERY. IN OTHER WORDS ITS AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD. I CAN STUNLOCK THEM TO DEATH ALSO LEADING ME TO NOT GET MAD IF I GET STUN LOCKED TO DEATH COMPLETELY UNLIKE ELDEN RING, WHERE BOSSES HAVE ENDLESS STAMINA (unlike the melee characters who can only do 4 hits, or atleast samurai can only do that the character im playing..). Enemys also often 2 or 3 shot me while I have put the last 30 levels into damage through dexterity and gotten ONE damage point per level. ONE.

This game isnt even hard like the fanboys claim (and then just insult you and tell you to get good when you call out bosses tracing you mid attack during a dodge roll) its just watching, waiting to get a single or two hits in if youre melee then trying to bait out the correct range to do it again. The bosses have much more fun than the player characters they actually have cool combos and skillsets and get to play the game, the player character just stands and runs around waiting for the bosses endless combos to end.

It all depends on repeating the same sequences and building muscle memory, but you know what I would do instead if I had so much time? I would learn to play an instrument and leverage muscle memory for something useful, not this nonsense!

Absolutely no evolution from the first Souls game in terms of gameplay and mechanics.
The most annoying part is that bosses and mini-bosses don't react to your actions whatsoever. They just do not care what you are doing. They got hit? Who cares? You blocked their attack? Nothing. It's like you don't even exist to them, so you are just playing with yourself really.

Putting 5-10 hours into this game gave me both a skinking sense of deja-vu and the feeling of forcing myself to eat fistfuls of overly sweet cake.

If, like me, you have played this series since Demon's Souls, you will realise Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4. Or Demon's Souls 2 - It doesn't really matter at this point.

Other than the *slightly* more open world structure (the 'Souls series was always somewhat open in structure) and Torrent the goathorse, everything is exactly the same as all the previous games, including elements from Bloodborne and Sekiro.

Same player classes and animations?
Same enemy design, including enemy types/classes?
Same pseudo-mediaeval world, with lonely atmosphere?
Same dead-eyed, hollow-voiced NPCs?
Same controls and combat system?
Same telling of the opaque story and world lore through item descriptions?
Same, boring, grindy progression system?
Same die-and-die-again repetitive gameplay?
Enroaching feeling that you are wasting your life playing updates to the same game released well over a decade ago?

'Yes' to all of the above.

Mashing together your previous 4 games and adding a horse is in no way innovative or good, by any metric. This is one of the laziest 'masterpieces' I have ever seen.

It used to be fun, but its just the same bland thing over and over again.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"Tagline : ""Most overrated Runescape clone, hyped up by people who hate the fact that GTA and Assassin's Creed are popular""

What specs you need to run it 60fps - 1080p or 4K, without stutter or lag?
- Honest answer is that, no matter how good your PC is, no matter, if you have PS5, this game will perform horribly and only thing you can do is wait for multiple patches.

This game goes into same category of games, that have been extremely overhyped and extremely underdelivered. Other examples would be ""Cyberpunk 2077"", ""Fallout 76"", ""Anthem"", ""Battlefield 2042"" and ""Elden Ring"" is another fine addition to that list.

So what new groundbreaking mechanics, graphics, open world design, innovative combat or interesting story this game offers? - Pretty much none of these.

Graphically (for some weird reason) this game goes back to 2012/2013. But 2012/2013 had lots of great games and at times ""Elden Ring"" even looks beautiful, especially the sky, but ground and grass textures are pretty much worse than some 2013 games. For 2022 AAA release this is bad. Game that gets Metascores 95/97 in 2022, should have way more work put into it.

Next up is open world design - There's extreme amount of boring looking, absolutely empty areas. This is automatically bad open world design, because these empty areas, that doesn't even look good have zero purpose to be there. Other areas that actually have something, okay let's make that clear, all that other areas have is trees and monsters. Endless amount of monsters that are simply sitting there, doing nothing, waiting for you to slay them. This is literally Runescape game design 101, i have been playing Runescape since 2004, i know what i'm talking about.

Quests (if you can even call them) are extremely short, boring and you can literally ignore all of them. It's usually some lady asking you to go somewhere, get something, get it back to her. Most hilarious thing is that game doesn't show that you have completed any of them, which basically means that by the end of the game, you forget that you even did these. Runescape has more complex lore, quests and writing than this game can only dream of. Why i'm talking about Runescape and not Skyrim, you might ask - Well because lore wise, Skyrim would be too tough challenger for this game.

Combat is extremely similar to Dark Souls 3, game that released 6 years ago. Same animations, same everything. Anyone who says in that case that ""Innovation is overrated"" has no right to criticize Rockstar or Ubisoft ever again, just saying.

Anyone who says that having horse is innovative must be a troll, because having this empty open world without any transportation, would be almost insulting.

All in all very weak release, only fun i had in this whole game were two boss fights - Margit and Godrick, i have to say they have extremely unfair combos, attacks and they are pointlessly difficult to beat, especially for 2 first bosses, but at least they have some interesting lore and cool monster design.

1 point for beautiful sky design, 1 point for Margit boss design and 1 point for Godrick boss design.

The only way I can see why people love this game is the challenge of the bosses and dungeons.

This is basically a mediocre open world game with incredibly difficult and epic boss fights. Nothing more. It's mildly fun.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"in my first review I had given a grade 4 on the ps5 version, the grade 4 is referring to performance not to the game, so I decided to play the ps4 version which is backward compatible on the ps5 and the game is much, much better than the ps5 version, the game starts a little monotonous and then it gets very good, really addictive, that's why I changed the note from 4 to 9 because it's a very good game, I'm being fair with the developers, when they fix the ps5 version I'll give it 10",77,206

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"It's like ""The Evil Within"" (2014), but bad. Really similar atmosphere, but something went wrong. People often say that ""The Evil Within"" is hard game (bosses are hard) and i have always ""kind of"" agreed, but i never cared when i died in ""The Evil Within"", because the whole game was extremely fun, so i always knew that whenever i beat this boss, there will be some cool new area after that, story goes on, etc. But even more, ""The Evil Within"" boss fight were actually fun, very challenging yes, but fun. Elden Ring is complete opposite. Nothing interesting happens after i beat this insanely overpowered boss and also, none of these fight are actually fun or enjoyable. All bosses in Elden Ring are extremely unfairly balanced against you. There's huge different between ""Challenging boss"" and ""Unfairly balanced boss"". Only boss you can't really kill (until you have met her at least 3-4 times) in The Evil Withing is Laura. She is also most difficult boss in the whole game, because she is ""one hit kill"" boss. The moment she touches you, you are dead. Is she unfairly balanced? NO. Because all you have to do is run away from her. That's the ""fight"", you have to be able to escape her and by the way, it's not easy at all. She can also teleport and she is extremely fast, so yeah, very challenging, but not unfairly balanced, because it's obvious what you have to do to beat her, there are rules. Elden Ring has zero rules. Most of these bosses in Elden Ring have completely randomized combos, attacks, special attacks, stuns, etc. That's what unfairly balanced means. You never know what they do. Never. They can have attack that hits you four times and right after that they hit you with some random combo, jump on you, etc. That's just nonsense. That's not fun, that's not enjoyable and that's why The Evil Within boss fights are fun and Elden Ring boss fight are not. This is obviously just my opinion, but i personally don't enjoy playing unfairly balanced games, so i rather stick to great games that actually make some sense.",77,208

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"This game is a pile of garbage. The greedy developers copied and pasted the same animations from Dark Souls 3. The developers were too cheap and lazy to make new animations. The animations and graphics are very outdated for a next gen AAA $60 game. The AI is incredibly stupid. The developers were too greedy and lazy to make sophisticated AI, so they just gave the enemies too much health in a pathetic attempt at making the game difficult. This formula is getting so old. FromSoftware games aren't even that hard. All it takes to beat their games is learn the enemy patterns, dance around and have patience when attacking. There are clipping issues. I saw a monster's entire head magically go through a solid wall.

There is nothing to do in the open world. Just an empty space full of grass, trees, and rocks. That is so boring to explore. Speaking of rocks, I tried jumping off a cliff so I can land on the other cliff, only for my player to get stuck in between and die. This awful bug could have easily been prevented had the developers add climbing mechanics. The developers are so lazy, they can't even add basic climbing mechanics. In what world does a modern AAA open world game lack climbing mechanics? That is embarrassing. It gets even more embarrassing when I encounter more game breaking bugs. I called my horse and hopped on It, only for my character to magically float in the air and stay stuck there to die. I experienced this bug multiple times. The physics are a joke. The plants don't even react to your movement, a basic feature many modern open world AAA games have. Even indie developers add that feature.

The PvP multiplayer is complete trash and unbalanced. I had a player kill me, only because they had a character 20 times more powerful than mines. This game gets more unfair when I had an enemy AI killing me with a spear that was 5 inches away from my face. The game punishes me for terrible and lazy game design. $60 is too expensive for this poor expensive of a game. It is recycled trash and a cash grab. I don't recommend this game at all.",44,172
"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Fromsoft continues to use archaic mechanics in the name of difficulty while other developers that were inspired to create difficult games because of fromsofts (undeserved) critical reception have seemingly all surpassed them in every aspect of game design from combat to traversal to designing a fun difficulty curve, absolutely not a “must play” for anyone unfamiliar with fromsoft’s past games",7,7

You don't even need armor because the bosses will always two shot you. You could spend over an hour trying to complete a dungeon and get nothing as a reward.I bet that if this game came out from an unknown publisher it wouldn't get a 96 rating which is way too high.

"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"Technically game is not next-gen and uses forced chromatic aberration filter to hide graphical flaws. Lots of texture and mesh pop in, mostly on environments.
A lot of enemies and bosses are reskins from previous games, same goes for the players character animations. In a lot of cases not only animations but entire models are simply copied from previous games (giant crabs etc).
Mechanically game is identical to any soulsborne game, meaning controls (especially for keyboard &amp; mouse) are inconvenient for 2022. UI is horrendous.
Main bosses are forgettable and the world even tho it is open, feels empty or meaningless. Extremely large MMO buildings and areas - aka. exaggerated just for the sense of awe while inside is usually just an empty box. Soulsbourne cryptic type npcs work in linear games where you will meet them no matter what - these quest types are not fit an open world scenario.
Music is uninspiring.
Its an overhyped game with a horrible PC port.",3,3
"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,Could be the best game ever but the buggy laggy mess destroyed this game to me...lag input is a thing in this game...unplayable game,3,3
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"As a disclaimer, I'm not one of the ""souls games should have an easy mode"" crowd, and I've cleared every soulsborne title to date.

Elden Ring offers one of the most expansive, most carefully crafted and painstakingly curated open world experiences ever created. The game, it's environments, it's enemies, lore and set pieces are all stellar, there's so much to do, explore and conquer here assuming you're up to the game's considerable challenge.

The only reason this isn't a straight 10/10 experience, is I feel FromSoft, in search of ensuring the difficult experience translates over to an open world game, have sacrificed fairness in some aspects of the game and have also left in some of the jankier aspects of souls combat that really should have been addressed by now. Firstly, melee is grossly out shined by magic and status effects, the balance here is very poor for a game that focuses so much on melee combat. Input delay is fairly prominent and makes the experience feel a little less fluid than previous games. Hitboxes vary between ultra precise and horrendous depending on the enemy. Jank within it's combat systems remains, for example I can knock an enemy down, and it's completely untouchable until it stands up, meanwhile enemies can wail on me if they knock me down. There are several instances of twin boss encounters that just use two of a normal boss you already fought, many of these aren't balanced for a duo encounter. There are some bosses that forgo the tight reaction based combat of previous entries and rely on what can only be described as random, uncounterable flailing around and/or AOE spam, thankfully these aren't present in great numbers. Player experience would be greatly enhanced if the map gave a recommended level range for its zones. Unlike previous more linear entries, I can see people calling the game out as impossible, when they just wandered into a high level zone accidentally as many of the high level areas are directly next to low level ones with nothing restricting access. Balance at higher levels is also off, many attacks are a one or two shot kill at the vigor softcap, meaning even if you stack HP your survivability is still exceptionally poor, this once again favours magic over melee.

Anyway, I know that's a lot of negatives, this is still a fantastic souls game, but it's also the one I've had to put down in frustration the most. With new territory comes new BS to iron out, hopefully by Elden Ring 2 we'll have better balance, but don't let that put you off trying this.",2,2

"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,"Very buggy, can't even hit 60fps on ps5 steadily even though a game as heavy as Ghost of Tsushima runs at a locked 60fps with no loading time, this is very unoptimized. I die randomly at elevators, horrible grass pop in, dungeons and most other world bosses are copy and paste, game is hard in late game just for the sake of being hard, seems like From has forgot why people play these games. Sekiro and Bloodborne were their best games, and those games were difficulty done right. No matter how much of a tank you're, everything in haligtree and snowy mountaintops will 2 shot you. Enemies and bosses are designed to attack you as soon as you hit square to heal, crucible Knights will just stand there do nothing but as soon as you press R1 their hitting animation will start and they'll hit you first, it's just designed to F you over. I sound like a broken record but the game is difficult just to F with the player. It's unfair, you get gank boss fights in every corner of the game, they went back to dark souls 2 days where they put 500 enemies in one room and they call that fair difficulty. Godskin duo!?? Really!!? Seems like they ran out of time and were like ""aha! Let's put these 2 bosses in one room and call it a new boss, oh also. Let's make them self revive"". Also, this game shat on the face of every STR player , by making every strength weapons scale with either INT or FAI. Even if you get one of these heavy weapons, it'll be absolutely useless, because every late game boss is gonna be 100 times faster than you, rendering your STR build useless. Btw I can't wait to see this review on r/Eldenring since they're a bunch of crybabies that don't let people criticise their god miyazaki or they'll post these reviews on there.",2,2

Need too much attention and we need to do a self database-like ourselves to get anything from this game ( or googling it, RIGHT.. That's really fun playing like that) .

Graphically the game looks great on PS5 particularly if you like Dark gritty games. The battle system is hack and slash with dodge rolls and timed dodges. If you are bad at dodging plan to die alot. If you aren't good at games like dark souls then you probably will die quite often. It feels like a darker version of Zelda Breath of the wild mixed with Dark souls.The game has quite a bit of customization and you get to design character at the beginning. It is essentially a more advanced dark souls 3. If you're looking for a challenge this game has plenty maybe even enough to make you rage quit.",1,1

That's where Elden Ring makes the game so much more accessible!Not only are there sensible checkpoints in this game but thanks to the open world design, you can mostly run past difficulty spike foes and come back for them when you've levelled up. A few of my Soulsborne gripes are withstanding... You still need to grind/farm to level up and you need to rely heavily on Google/YouTube to figure out how to do stuff, so I've knocked a couple of points off for those irks.",1,1

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"My overall impression of this game was completely ruined by the Malenia boss fight.
I loved it up to that point, but that encounter just takes a dump on everything Dark Souls and its spinoffs have stood for throughout the years, namely being difficult but fair.
Basically, for any person who is below god tier at Souls games, this fight is impossible to win in any normal way. If you want to progress past it, you're forced to respec to a ""cheese build"" that relies on abusing game mechanics rather than fight fair and square like you're supposed to.

I've seen a lot of comments on various forums about this being the worst boss fight in the history of From Software, and I agree.
The Malenia boss fight is the pinnacle of bad game design.",1,1
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"FROM Soft games has always been know for their difficult but mostly for their ""japanese"" minimalism. Worlds reduced down to their bare framework - the sense of dreadness, of being hopeless lost in a almost impossible quest. Hope never emerges in Dark Souls, their NPCs destined to die or become hollow. NPCs have few words for you, and the ending which is never a end, just the restart of an eternal loop of despairing and suffering.I played DS for many years. And I was expecting, hoping that this pureness would be preserved in Elden Ring.Instead, I just spoke to some woman who wants me to deliver a letter. Another one was looking for her husband ? Not sure anymore, as I'm not sure what I'm really doing in this game, beside galloping around, collecting flowers and occasionally face some monster. I guess Im supposed to do something but whatever - is more fun and rewarding just to scavenge around as the next shiny item could be just past that rock.And this is the first issue with this game.The second one is what I call ""artificial difficulty"". For some reason some 10 minutes into the game (following the beam guiding you) you hit a boss which is probably good for someone level 40 with well-upgraded weapon. Lets take DS for example, or DS2 / DS3. The first bosses are level-appropriate, doable with a unupgraded weapon, fairly slow and easy to read. Here we deal with a multi-combo jumping spinning area-of-attack as large as ever devil. In DS this would have been a mid-game boss, where you already are familiar with the game and have elemental weapons and so on. But Elden Ring expect me to run around to look for a good weapon, upgrade it, level up some 30 times before I can have a chance.So the game does not do a good job telling you ""yor are underpowered"" - specially as you can stroll by most of enemies to hit the next resting place.So we have now underpowered users sitting in front of a monster boss. And here lies the 3d Elden Ring Problem.While in the past summoning help was the equivalent to ""help me"", this time summoning someone makes things worse. Bosses have more health, do more damage, and the limitation in matchmaking to just be able to summon someone around your level means there are now two underpowered users facing the beast. With the usual deadly consequences. The problem here is mixing the old formula of similar-level to matchmaking with the open world. Soons the users will be spread on such a large level range (also weapon level counts in matchmaking, and there are 25 levels), that coop will become almost impossible.It is still a good game, specially if you play solo. But the magic of the old ""jolly cooperation"" is sadly no more there.",1,1

"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"I LOVE:
- how hard the game is by design (it's challenging)
- great graphics (ps5)
- great scary / tense atmosphere
- the use of hiding being a key threat response

I don't care for or am frequently frustrated by:
- How incredibly easy it is to miss hitting an enemy, even one who is point blank, not moving, cowering on his knees right in front of me.  That seems to come from disappointing precision and intent-adjusted collision enablement / detection capabilities

I HATE !!! :

1) My friends and I really hate how terrible the multiplayer teaming has been designed.
- The open world is not open world for your friends, their only objective is to help you kill an area boss
- The process to actually connect a friend to my game or vice versa is among the most labor-intensive of it's kind that I've seen
- A death experienced by people in my world fully removes them from my world (aka, my group) and recovery only comes from repeating the laborsome process above
- There is no way for friends to sustain each other (no revive, heal requires unreasonable proximity (as do caster dps abilities, no resource / loot sharing)

The part we hate is likely to prematurely sour our fun too much and push us away.  I value the survival nature of the game but the process used now is really no different than the mobile games that force me to wait time before I can progress....you are forcing me to wait the time it takes me to find those flowers and make the pieces to summon someone.....and then meander about trying to find where they put their little runes I have to click on.

The graphics work, Sound design, animations, and frankly just all the visuals are very subpar.  This game does not look good by any means but it does have fantastic art direction which go a long way.

It's a good game, held back from being great simply because it's makers only know how to create difficulty in a game in one way.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"It's all opinion but I'm surprised by the masterpiece status. This game is addictive af, I can play for an aggregious amount of time but I'd still put it below DS1, DS3, BB, and Sekiro. I may be unable to put it down but that doesn't make it the best, the gameplay loop just never feels concluded.For all the amazing aspects of the game and being the most refined Dark Souls (specifically) combat, there's just more busy work and lack of intentional pacing than the rest of Fromsoft's greats. It never reaches the highs the other games do and though it's open world, it feels much less of a unique and revolutionary game changer like BB or Sekiro were to the Fromsoft format (I consider those 2 games masterpieces and my favorite Fromsoft combat systems). The open world is cool but it does make everything feel less specifically intended and crafted, &amp; you're often either over leveled or underleverd for an area. And while the areas can be beautiful they don't stand out in memory to me like DS1 interconnected world, BB amazing Lovecraft aesthetic, or Sekiro beauty and fun traversal.And while the world style feels reminiscent of Breath of the Wild as you figure it out naturally without markers or arbitrary blocks, it pales in comparison with little variety in gameplay when you explore, just different enemies and visual environments.I'd honestly have preferred a DS4 or BB 2 or Sekiro 2 over this tbh. Open world is cool but I haven't really found any reason why this is an improvement to a the semi linear design of the other games; I've mostly found it amusing at some points, and frustrating at others.It also has more bugs than either BB (which ran low fps at times but the graphics stayed consistent) or Sekiro did on the PS4. Quality mode is literally unplayable, with likely sub 30 fps, and performance mode has noticable pop in. It's weird how I think it's more visually sparse than those 2 games but has more trouble running on brand new hardware.Still, game of the year for me no doubt. Even a bad Fromsoft game (like DS2, which I do enjoy) is still miles ahead of most AAA studios. So this being great, but not a masterpiece imo, makes it a joy to play.It's the first AAA in awhile that I felt worthy of the price and genuinely want to finish while living up to expectations (I didn't expect it to be a 10/10, more like 8.5/10).",1,1

This game's depth in terms of combat and exploration, is immense. I just wish there were more story snippets (like pages/books we could collect and read, and actual written clues with scroll aesthetics) &amp; NPC involvement. They did add this to a degree, but not as much as I would've liked.

I don't mind the lack of ""UX"" or user interface. In fact, I actually prefer that, because it brings me back the nostalgia that I used to have when I first played videogames as a child/teen. Wow quests didn't hold your hand before; You used to have to figure out the quest by actually reading the journal and piecing together hints or directions. There used to be a point to the flavor text hidden throughout the world in wow.

Castlevania games never held your hand, and neither did super Mario, or Metroid, or Fable 1, or Morrowind, or even Pokemon. They didn't have quest lists/instructions, or directional arrows, and their user interface was very minimal. Those games made me feel like I was on an adventure in another world, and it was amazing.

Elden bring had brought me that feeling as well, so I'm very satisfied with my overall experience. My only gripes are with the poor PC port (they don't even have proper keybinds displayed), and because I would've liked more rich story involvement, or misc lore writings scattered throughout the land. Granted, the story and lore that's already there is amazing... But I think there could've been more, without watering it down to ""fetch me/slay this"" generic quests. It's just that there are barely any cities with NPCs that aren't trying to kill you. I know it's a From Soft game, but that's simply what I would've enjoyed more; an occasional change of pace for a game of this vastness. It's also nice to have some places for respite, with some familiar faces (outside of the round table, because that's only ONE place which isn't even on the map).

We can't even ask our maiden to join us by a fire or anything of the sort.",1,1

If you like from software games will be satisfied
As a disadvantage
the frame is not stable
Incomprehensible storytelling
It was good to make it in the open world, but it was more suitable for the open world
I wish it was user-friendly
no quest list
It is difficult to know the change of the quest without attack
Even if it is a bit inconvenient to find npc
When you complete the quest, you have to go to another place and search for it again.
It is difficult to fight with a sword because of frequent escapes among the enemy bosses
From software stable gameplay

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,Towards the end game the game gets less fun and more frustrating as leveling gets harder as enemies and bosses 1 shot you despite your rune level and armor making it more frustrating than fun when exploring towards the middle of the game. It losses the game loop as you find more things that don't go towards your  playstyle. You also can't summon less of you need help  and grinding becomes mandatory. Also you start getting repeat bosses only they have more health and do more damage causing bosses fatigue. An explorer mode needs to be added for those that like exploring lore rather than being forced to deal with repeat bosses already defeated,1,1
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"In all honesty it's more of the less the same souls stuff just in a big open world. It's good but it doesn't innovate the series. From all the reviews and playing it myself. I just don't really get what the fuss was about. Don't get me wrong it's a good game but it's definitely not a masterpiece. Same Combat you expected from a souls game. They need to in ovate by adding new animations and moves you can chain to make combos. Open world aspect is good for souls game. I love it but It personally doesn't offer a wow factor because the world is kinda lifeless outside of the NPCs, the classes are awesome, customization is always nice despite the armor being the way majority of the time lmfao. Difficulty is good for new comers this time around. That's about it I don't really talk about the lore because that's not the forefront for these style of games kinda got to roam around the world to find it. Classes are pretty awesome.",1,1

"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"Elden Ring es una experiencia que no estoy muy seguro como describir, es por momentos excelente, por momentos frustrante, divertido la mayoría del tiempo, repetitivo en algunas ocasiones. Es una aventura variada, con altos y bajos, pero jamás termina por decepcionar.

En general tengo sentimientos encontrados con este título, supere las 50 horas con él, que es mucho más de lo que le dedico a otros juegos. Esto puede ser un punto positivo para muchos, pero a mí me genera dudas. Es agobiante la gran cantidad de terreno por recorrer, cada rincón es hostil y cualquier bicho va a intentar matarte, pero a la vez es gratificante superar los retos que te propone y mejorar a nuestro personaje gracias a eso. Luego siento que no es algo nuevo, que ya lo jugué antes, que es un Dark Souls a gran escala, pero a la vez las invocaciones y otros añadidos, más los nuevos jefes y un mapa precioso que vas descubriendo de a poco, es lo mas fresco que tiene la saga y lo llena de posibilidades.

En definitiva, es un juego genial, continuista por demás, pero lleno de sorpresas por todos lados. No me parece la gran obra maestra que esperaba y que estuve leyendo por las redes, pero es otro gran juego del genio de Miyazaki y un punto y aparte en su carrera.",1,1
"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"It's a good game, but it has a ton of issues. The bosses, the visuals the atmosphere are all great as usual, very distinct very interesting, combat is fun as always, the rpg elements are expanded greatly and there are some great quality of life improvements as well.

But the open world is a huge miss in my experience it's great in theory and sometimes it really WOWs you, but it's also full of emptyness, copy paste dungeons and many more bugs than usual. It also causes this weird dynamic where you have to guess if you're the right level for each given encounter even on the main path which causes a very weird difficulty curve. The game also has pretty long walk and loadtimes on death. These 2 together waste so much time, you either commit to practicing the boss with sometimes minutes of downtime between attempts or you go and grind on the side. It's not difficult, it's tedious. The game also gives you a ton of tools to help you deal with bosses like summons upon summons, crazy spells, ashes and weapons etc which makes the game feel even less consistant in difficulty. There are also technical issues like bosses freezing up, constant stuttering, floor disappearing, map not loading, very long loadtimes, hit detection issues, crashes, dying upon reloading your save etc.

I feel like fromsoft games started going in the right direction with bloodborne and sekiro, but elden ring takes a very different angle. It feels like where bloodborne and sekiro cut fat off and refined the formula, elden ring just put it back 2 fold. It's still a good game and it's going to entertain both souls fans and people new to these games, but I think the issues are pretty big and warrant a high-mixed review.",1,1
"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"After days and days of seeing this game praised to the end of the earth and back I picked up a copy to try my hand.

I strongly recommend waiting several months for some updates to make this game playable. I will revisit this review when the game's technical mess is fixed on PS5 or PC.

Pros
- The bosses are very cool and quiet unique, and very fun to fight (when the fps isn't falling through the floor)
- The world is very beautiful despite the old engine
- The variety of classes, weapons, and items to pick up is great and fun to play around with
- The open world is great to explore and very enjoyable, feels very fun to feel like I'm discovering secrets

Cons
- From a technical perspective this game is a mess. The frame rate is abysmal, even in performance mode but especially in quality mode. I couldn't play more than 20 minutes without getting motion sick, and had to stop several times because of this
- Frame rate is about 40-55fps, never stable, and was occasionally dropping to less than 20.
- The game is intentionally hostile to anyone who hasn't played the previous games and is very inaccessible, and has no interest in engaging new players to its obtuse systems
- The UI is actively terrible. Finding items, figuring out how to upgrade items, figuring out what to do with runes, even closing the map, are all made intentionally obtuse for seemingly no reason. A simple example; the button to open the menu and to close the menu are two different buttons for no good reason, completely wasting the limited buttons available on a controller. Every button was very unintuitive to me

This is a game made only for fans, and even though I think there's a lot to be enjoyed, feeling like the developers are constantly trying to hamstring me in stupid (and not game play related) ways and sell me a product that is extremely unoptimized is not my idea of fun.",1,1
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,as much as I'm sick of open world games Elden ring did it well its a interesting world with cool looking enemies but sadly that's all it has. the bosses are super easy i was under leveled for all of them and it never took me more then 5 tries to beat them.  There are to many sites of grace. i never lost any runes because i was always a 20 second walk away from where I died. overall its a fun game but with the hype and the underwhelming fights it falls short.,1,1

This is my first Dark Souls game so I know I still have a lot to learn as far as gameplay goes but it seems just alright so far. Controls aren't really intuitive, enemies look stiff and lifeless.

Having said this the game is not perfect like everyone keeps making it out to be. On PS5 the frame rates aren’t stable which is important in a souls game to be able to time your dodges and attacks. Also enemies sometimes get stuck in the environment where you can attack them not sure what causes that. All on all it’s a must buy for souls lovers.

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,This game is the Magnum Opus of From Software.  An accumulation of everything they have done and learned to date and presented in an enormous package.  The scale of the world feels incredible and the area/world design is second to none.  The combat is similar to Dark Souls 3 with slight changes such as a jump button and guard counters and more.  There are always things to nitpick but there will not be a game this year or likely next that captures my attention quite like this.  Be prepared to be left in awe by every new location you discover.  And there will likely be some that you miss.  Same world design philosophy as Dark Souls 1 in a much larger scale.,1,1
"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"If you like exploring alien worlds and landscapes, even if the entire population and bestiary is hostile to you ON SIGHT, and you don't need a compelling reason to do any of it, because you are fine with making it up on your own, or just love a challenge for the sake of a challenge, or you believe that killing things and taking their stuff is its own reward... then this game is truly is a 10 out of 10. On top of that, this game is BEAUTIFUL. The enemy design is breathtaking. You will find joy in discovering the 100's of varied enemy creatures that dot the landscape. There is so much to find - and kill - in this game.

However, the game is an endless repetition of set piece battles, that reset immediately when you get to a check point and pause the game. This reset breaks the immersion of the world, and reminds you that this is just a game, and these characters are just automatons, going through the motions, like some kind of fun house. There are TONS of hidden weapons, armors, and enemies, just waiting for you to find them. But the game only provides a backstory for the Bosses and NPC's. It doesn't actually give you a detailed or compelling reason as to why you're killing them all. Did they do something to you? Destroy your people? Who ARE your people? You can't be from this land, because NOBODY apparently lives here except the monster automatons.

That is why this game is a solid 7. It gives you LOTS and LOTS of things to discover and kill. It's a visual masterpiece. But the game controls are difficult, your character animations are woefully slow compared to your enemies, the game's economy/xp system was designed for the grinders, and the game provides ZERO context or a compelling narrative in which you can take part.

SOLID 7/10.",1,1
"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,I personally think Elden ring is an amazing game. A challenging one but in my opinion the challenges are fun. Though you will be stuck at some parts for a bit of time. If you enjoy the souls games I ensure you that this is a game you don’t want to miss.,1,1

If you played any of the previous souls games then I think you’ll like it.

"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"Elden ring is probably one of the best and worst games I have ever played. It’s so nice to see FromSoft try a new type of game and they nailed it. The one thing about the game is the bosses, every single one is probably one of the most BS thing I have ever witnessed. Every boss is insanely aggressive, you can never heal unless you have RNG of the gods, combos never finish, etc. since it is open world, boss arenas don’t fell like arenas, it’s just a flat area for most of them. There’s so many trees and rocks to easily get stuck on (and From Software games really have something with getting stuck in corners). The duo fights are absolute dumb because there is no way to split them up and both the enemy’s have practically the same speed and aggression. Seriously, I love this game, but the bosses ruined every part of it for me. Yeah i know you can run away from it, level up some, then come back, but that’s another problem. Every boss feels like it’s over leveled compared to you, making you always skipping them unless you have balls of steel. And the sheer amount of bosses in this game (like 150) makes you forget about most, so you’re skipping out on half the bosses when you complete it. Plus, they recycled many bosses. I have seen so many bosses recycled such as: beast guy behind Morne Castle, Tree Sentinel, that dumbass knight with the wings, and many more. Amazing game, would totally recommend, probably shouldn’t get GOTY, but it’s still great. Good luck on those stupid designed bosses though.",1,1
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"Reseña en español:

Para empezar he de decir que el juego es una gran obra, un sobresaliente en esta industria sin duda, pero al igual que cualquier obra, tiene sus cosas buenas y sus cosas malas, por lo que me gustaria comenzar con lo positivo:

1. La direccion artistica es simpemente increible, los diferentes castillos, mansiones, aldeas y demas componenetes del mundo, incluso los propios enemigos y jefes de zona, se sienten unicos y diferentes entre si, todo hecho con una fijacion en el detalle abrumadora, ademas de que dependinedo del punto desde donde se mire, la complejidad del escenario es mejor o un tanto inferior respecto a lo que aparenta, lo que le da un aire de mistisismo al no saber que te encontraras.

2. Las mecanicas, el combate y el gameplay se sienten muy bien a la hora de estar jugando, estan bien planteados cada uno de estos apartados hilado a la clase de personaje que se escoja previamente al inicio del juego, de la mano con la dificultad progresiva del mismo, la jugabilidad es simplemente reconfortante a cada paso que das en la aventura.

3. El diseño de nivel es simpemente perfecto, cosa a la que ya nos tiene acostumbrados su estudio desarrollador con sus anteriores titulos, pero sumandole aun mas cosas gracias a la nueva faseta de mundo abierto. Las posibilidades para completar una zona son casi infinitas, y en ningun momento sientes que algo que no cuadre a tu alredor, todo esta en su sitio por alguna razon, y tu misison es descubrirla.

4. El manejo del mundo abierto bebe mucho de The Legend of Zelda: breath of the wild, osea que todo lo que descubras depende enteramente de tu manera de jugar y tu atencion en la exploracion, lo cual da una sensacion de inmersion enorme, no hay iconos indicandote a donde ir, no hay npcs que te den un numero exagerado de tareas para que te veas en la obligacion de explorar, nada de eso, fromsoftware se esmero en que tu fueras quien forjara tu propio camino.

Puntos negativos:

1. Como ya es bien sabido el rendimiento en las diferentes plataformas no es nada optimo, y las consolas tanto de pasada generacion como de la actual son las que en peor estado se encuentran, teniendo un modo rendimiento que oscila entre los 40 y 60 fps, algo no acorde a lo que se espera de un titulo lanzado en estas consolas, junto con esto, su apartado grafico brilla por ser un tanto mediocre, practicamente luce como un juego de hace minimo 5 años.

2. El juego no cuenta con una explicacion por lo menos basica de ciertas misones secundarias, practricanente no te dice nada, por lo que la mayoria de jugadores, creo yo, que se veran obligados a ver algun tipo de guia o ayuda de otros jugadores, lo cual le quita merito a la inmersion, en el caso de no hacer esto, lo mas probable es que te pierdas algun tipo de recompensa o bifurcacion importante de la historia.

2. Hay un numero considerable de enemigos y zonas recicladas entre si, por ejemplo, es muy probable que te encuentres con un jefe secundario mas de una vez, e incluso, una de estas veces puedes encontrartelo como un enemigo comun y corriente, lo cual hace que la lucha contra un enemigo que parezac medianamente importante pierda peso y relevancia, asi como algunas mazmorras son repetitivas e incluso cancinas.

3. No queda muy claro hacia que tipo de jugador va dirigido el juego, lo que si queda claro, es que aunque la libertad de eleccion se ve camuflada por las clases de personaje al principio, al avanzar en la eventura parace que todo te lleva a pensar que es un juego para clases que manejen magia y hechizos, en mi experiencia personal, que jugue con la clase ""Vagabundo"", me ecnontre con mas de un enemigo al que mi armadura, por mas fuerte que fuese, no parecia hacerle frente, esto junto a una barra de vida que parece ser ignorada por los enemigos, te da la sensacion de que estas jugando erroneamente.

4. La interfaz y el HUD son toscos y anticuados para los tiempos que corren, acciones que deberian tomarte como mucho 5 segundos, aqui te toman el triple, tiempo durante el cual, al no existir una pausa, pueden matarte perfectamernte.

Elden Ring es un juego maravilloso, pero no es un 10/10, aunque para todo fan de la saga y la dificultad vale completamente la pena.",1,1
"Mar 17, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"Copy &amp; paste bosses throughout the game, every boss except 3. Bosses copied from other souls games, &amp; the AI &amp; hit boxes are terrible. The input lag is really bad, yet few souls players call out from software about this. Maybe delusional players, because they love the "" challenge"" of a truly broken game.",1,1
"Mar 18, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"I barely ever write reviews, but felt the need to leave one for this game.

The reason for this is not that I want to tank the game; far from it. However, I bought this game strictly because of its absurdly high critics score and ended up spending 100$ on a game I would not have bought had I known it was just as inaccessible as classic Souls games.. Indeed, even if I am not generally a fan of the Souls like genre, I assumed that a nearly perfect review score meant that this was a game for everyone.

I was severely disappointed

Now, it's not that I instantly dislike any game from this genre. I LOVED Star Wars : Fallen Order (can't wait for the sequel) and I had a love/hate relationship with Returnal (loved the story and concept but thought the frustrating gameplay was unnecessary).

Elden Ring started out fine. Being an RPG fan first and foremost I loved the character customization options, as well as the diversity of classes, stats and skills (even though it is a lot to take in all at once). The story is intriguing at first, as the opening does not give you a lot of information but does seem to set up an interesting premise.

The disappointment, however, essentially started there for me. You venture out into the world, with no real story narrative. I roamed from one uninteresting enemy group to another, simply grinding to get stronger. This grind is incredibly tedious as combat with your average enemy is often monotonous and repetitive.

Played the first boss, got killed 10 times straight, barely bringing it lower than 30% of its health. At this point I ask myself: is it the inherent difficulty of the game or is it that my character is too weak? In doubt, I venture back into the open world, grinding through boring enemies for a few hours before coming back to the boss. I try it 10 times more, exact same result. I go back to grinding for a few hours, and finally completely lose interest.

This game REALLY wasn't for me.

Now I really do understand that, for hardcore fans of the Soulslike genre, this might be the perfect game. Quite obviously, most review sites clearly handed the review for this game to the most hardcore of these fans they had on staff, which explains the scores. However, most gamers are not such fans of the genre, as it does have a very particular style that is not everyone. I wouldn't call it ""niche"", there are too many for such a restrictive term, but we are far from the generalized popularity of more classical genres.

Therefore, the review I'm writing is from the perspective of someone who is open to the genre, but not necessarily a fan of it..

The 6 I am giving this game is mostly for its visual qualities. I love the setting, the attention to details, the ambiance. You really feel as tough you are transported to another universe.

I, however, did not enjoy much beyond that.

As I mentioned before, combat, to me, was either way too hard or too easy, ultimately becoming uninteresting on either ones of these extremes. I usually don't mind banging my head against a difficulty wall until it breaks if there is motivation to push though. However, the narrative is so thin that I wasn't engrossed in the story, and, actually, the hours of getting killed and doing boring world fights dilutes it even further as the few narrative parts are stretched farther and farther away.

To me, these games should have two scores. One for fans and one for the rest of us. I guess give it a 10/10 for fans, but, t me, it barely made 6/10. I would say don't buy if you're not really sure.",1,1

"Mar 22, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,2,"Where do I even begin...Open world is a joke. It's a big mostly empty map, and your reward for exploration is always - hey fight these guys and get this item!! The world is static and boring for the most part. Movement or attacking feels laggy in a game that by all appearances should reward fast instincts.there is a huge input queue with no cancellation, so you're locked into the attack you pressed 1 second ago, even if the animation hasn't started and you try to do something else instead.  It's buggy, but called ""hard"" instead. I could go on but the other reviews cover it, so I'll just summarize:In general there is no joy to the game at all. The emotional arc of every sequence is ""grind, grind, grind, omg I finally beat it"". Good for masochists, narrow and painful for anyone else. On the plus side, marketing department clearly did a great job here.",1,1
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"I played all Dark Souls, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. I love all previous games created by From Software, but Elden Ring is meh... first of all, it's extremely boring. The world is enormous, I've already played for 50h and still around 10-20h to go. All parts of the universe are similar but with different textures. There are a few nice places, but not many.

Recipe for success: delete 50% of this empty world, balance boss fights (decrease spamming all around), delete copy&amp;paste bosses, make graphic quality similar to Demon's Souls, add an option to repeat boss fights, improve multiplayer to make it actually playable (some coop quests, etc.), add interesting items for all classes, not only sorcerers.

Boss fights? Do you remember fair, rewarding, interesting highly anticipated fights? Forget about it. Some bosses appear 5x or more!!! And they are exactly the same bosses copy&amp;paste! Forget about remembering moves, learning to recognize sequences, etc. Elden Ring is mostly about spamming during boss fights. Who spams faster wins. Bosses have sequences of 5-8 combos impossible to block very hard to roll, so If you think you can become good and avoid hits, just don't waste your time. No more rewarding fights.

Every souls game gives you 15-20 bosses and every single one is amazing. In Elden Ring, you have to play 50-70h and you get around 5 interesting bosses everything else is a disaster and spamming contest.

Update:
I've finally finished the game. It took 82h to get the platinum trophy. I was exploring almost everything. The good thing is that at the end you get more nice bosses, less generic bosses. However, I thought that in the middle of the game there was a spamming contest with bosses. In the end, it is much worse.

Wow, it’s dark! The GOT dude is involved! Swords and magic! The whole gaming industry and reviewers are on board because there is more profit in it for them. Don’t be a dumb kid, and don’t buy any more of these kinds of games. See it for what it really is. If we keep buying in, these are the only kinds of games we’ll ever get.

Far from the perfect game, but too interesting not to experience yourself.",6,7
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"This game is brilliant and disappointing at the same time, I feel like a lot of these problems is the symptom of being a open world game. I won't go into technical issues as those could be fixed later on and I want to review the actual game instead of how it looks.

Most bosses are amazing and fun to fight while others are some of the worst I have ever seen and I'm surprised they made it into the final game. The early boss fights to me seem higher quality and less gimicky/unfair than the later ones and I found fighting them going from fun to incredibly tedious and boring.

The dungeon design is incredibly frustrating with the way forward being chosen a random it seems, I think this was done to encourage exploration but it just leads to multiple times you run loops around a dungeon while getting very confused it makes me thankful for past souls games level design (mostly). I would say this overall is the worst dungeon design in any modern FromSoft game. A lot of the enemy placement in dungeons feels very spiteful as well, It gets tedious where there is a ambush every corridor or a instant kill trap you would not know is there until you died from it.

Random enemies normally don't give enough rewards to fight them leading to me just simply running past because I don't feel they are worth my time. I think this is due to the fact there are soo many enemies to fill up the world so they can't give that many rewards to balance the game.

Enemies also get reused a lot in the later areas leading to them feeling bland and lazy, including bosses. Like once you fought one dragon or Erdtree avatar you've fought them all.
The map did make me want to explore with landmarks but I often found myself saying ""That was it"" or ""That's disappointing"" the map looks more interesting than it actually is to me because I was always getting gear or weapons I will never use.

The level differences between areas is extreme where one minute your fine next you do next to no damage and get 1 shotted by everything, I think they should of had a gradient as you went further into areas where enemies got stronger the deeper you went instead of a line where a dog from one side is as weak as a pug and the other as strong as a wolf on steroids.

Fighting bosses you can often tell if your underleveled for them since their health goes up a ton leading to a test run of a boss and realising ""Oh I guess I'm too low level"". The bosses are doable at lower levels but incredibly tedious to fight since they take ages since the health bosses have is very generous and one mistake and you get one shotted, but also this works in the other way where bosses you missed feel way too easy and die in seconds. This often makes bosses feel like they are stat checkers.

Getting gear is a mixed bag, The builds you can do are amazing and I like the choice but getting that build is another story. You either have to get lucky with what you find or look up a guide since they are so spread out often leading to you feeling really weak cause you don't have anything decent or synergises well.

Ashes of war are a good addition and spice up the gameplay is unique ways. Spirit summons are a good feature as well to help out those who need a little extra help. However having as many upgrades as they do for weapons is a little ridiculous and not enough resources drop to give the player much freedom to upgrade loads of weapons to test them out.

Sorry for the rant but I love the game just like the other souls games but I am not one to sit back and not admit any of it's mistakes because this game makes many mistakes, and ones not learned from past souls games as well.",11,13
"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Well. It feels so clunky in comparison to sekiro. And I really don't understand the 97 Metascore and the 10/10 User hype. Why is this the best game ever?

Sure, It's from software and it's own genre yeah sure, but for me this is just a letdown and surely doesn't live up to the hype. Honestly this is not an innovative masterpiece. In no aspect.

Finding reasons to continue playing the game gets more and more difficult as time goes on. It is nowhere near FromSofts best entry, arguable being their worst. It feels like open world dark souls 1.

I don't like Fifa games, or CoD games, so I don't buy them and I don't play them, they're not for me. Some people really like spicy food, others don't. That's ok.

This game might not be for you. I would caution you to really know what you're getting into without spoiling the world. The gratification comes from FINALLY beating a boss after it kicks your teeth in so many times. It's about giving that feeling of gratification. But you've gotta have a bit of a stubborn personality to get there. To me, this is the game I've been waiting on my whole life. It's like getting immersed in my favorite book (I like things like Malazan or WoT to get an idea). It's big, it doesn't tell you where to go, there's a ton of story to uncover, lore to learn, places to see, maps to create, and nothing is hand held.

If you like that kind of thing, good luck, have fun, die a lot. If you don't, there's lots of games out there that you would enjoy instead that you should put your money towards.

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I have played open world RPGs for over many, many years, and have found that there are two paths that major developers are beginning to take. Either you spam the map full of useless, copy-pasted quests that any monkey can joyfully trot around the map and complete in order to progress some half-assed ""story"", or the developers sink their heart and soul into it. I first thought this when I played some of the Elder Scrolls games, then most recently with Breath of the Wild, and now finally the genre is combined with one of my most beloved franchises, Dark Souls. We see this in it's most grandeur display with Elden Ring. This game has blown me away in every way. All of the greatest, honed combat from a decade of development shows up here in satisfying, beautiful gameplay. All of the crazy world and character design from Miyazaki and his team is still present, and takes lots of elements both from Bloodborne and the Souls games. This is without even mentioning all of the work that George R.R. Martin helped out with, story-wise. You can definitely see elements from A Song of Ice and Fire within many of the quests and stories intertwined in Elden Ring. Overall, the gameplay hooked me, the story held me, and the boss/world design knocked it out of the park. I hope Fromsoftware continues with IPs like this, with custom characters and free-to-roam worlds, because I truly believe they are a pioneer in this way. Great game.",4,5
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,I don’t have a single bad thing to say about this game. I’ve enjoyed every second of the 60+ hours I have on this game.,4,5
"Mar 15, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"As an avid FromSoft fan, I must say that this game has not met the hype for me. Many of my fellow SoulsBorne fans are willing to overlook the deficiencies that the game has in its current state, but I am not sure doing so is fair. Like cases should be treated alike, and I wouldn't withhold criticism from another game with performance issues, design flaws, and gameplay weaknesses just because of brand loyalty (or in hopes of future updates and improvements that will more fully capitalize on the potential of the formula), so I will not do so here. My critiques can be boiled down to 2 general points (all approbations of the game left unspoken for the sake of brevity). I am reviewing on PS5. Also, I beat the game after 80+ hours of play.

1. Poor performance and failure to implement next-gen features. I've been playing through RDR2 while playing Elden Ring, and RDR2's graphics are noticeably better than Elden Ring's. I really admire Elden Ring's art direction, and found many in-game vistas quite beautiful, but they should be even more awe inspiring given the capabilities of the PS5. On top of lack luster graphics, the game's performance has been terrible at times. On many occasions, I've had frame rate drops that resulted in the screen, for all intents and purposes, being frozen. On top of that, throughout my entire play through, textures (trees, grass, etc.) wouldn't load in until my character was nearly on top of them. Watching environmental features pop into the screen left and right is really disappointing for a ""next-gen"" game, and is certainly an immersion breaker. My final complaint on this topic is the lack of haptic feedback implementation for PS5. Playing with a lifeless controller, after experiencing the allure of haptics with other PS5 games, is very disappointing (even RDR2 gives me some rumble here and there).

2. The open-world and the FromSoft formula is not a seamless fit. This game took me over 80+ hours to complete, and although I have faced greater boss challenges in other souls games, I was more mentally exhausted playing this game than any other FromSoft title. I don't think Elden Ring alters the From formula enough to achieve ""masterpiece"" status. My 80th hour was not as exciting as my 30th. After that many hours, new and complex areas with concomitant boss challenges become less rewarding and more taxing. By hour 65, I just wanted the game to end. There isn't enough diversity in gameplay to provide enjoyment over such an extended experience. Aesthetic difference between levels didn't make up for that lack of diversity, either. I imagine this complaint would register even more so for new players due to the lack of a strong and compelling narrative. I enjoy the FromSoft approach to narratives, but in a game of this size and scope, players need some sense of story-driven tension woven throughout the experience to keep them engaged. The intermittent narrative tension cobbled around boss encounters hardly suffices. All this to say, I would've enjoyed a smaller and shorter version of this game more than its current version. Its final form just feels bloated. Moreover, I think (emphasis on the tentative nature of this statement) the FromSoft formula works better in the previous iterations than it does here. There was not enough revision of that formula to warrant the immensity of this gaming experience. Challenge becomes chore when the game refuses to end.",4,5

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"First off, I can call myself a Soulsborne veteran at this point. After Bloodborne I went back and played every game since Demon’s Souls and even recently completed the remake. But the formula is getting boring and Elden Ring does literally nothing new outside of being set in a directionless open world. The move to an open world also destroyed everything that was actually fun about the earlier games. Secret shortcuts- almost none. Great rewards for defeating bosses you spent hours defeating- nope but hope you like getting a bunch of useless crafting materials or NOTHING AT ALL.The reviewers major outlets chose are mostly Fromsoft veteran fanboys who believe every Souls game is a masterpiece. If you’re a veteran like me and felt the games were getting a bit stale DO NOT BELIEVE the 97 score. This game does nothing revolutionary for Souls games or for open world titles.",13,17
"Mar 15, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I can't rate this game less than 10 just because is from my favorite series of all time.

The world is just one of the biggest there is and this is a good thing. Never ending exploring. ""Oh my god the world is empty bla bla..."" what do you expect? This is a SOULS game, not a fairy tale with butterflies. People need to understand that From Software always had a unique style, not like the garbage companies that throws unfinished games and even emptier worlds at the costumers at full price. This game IS a must play for the ones who like the series. For the others not so much.
From early to mid game it felt balanced, but THE GAME LACKS BALANCE TERRIBLY IN THE LATE GAME, but still i managed to beat it.

I believe most people could find some fun playing it for 20-50 hours.Then the critic, the second half could drag the rating down to hell. It feels like a change in design direction, in a bad way. The design reminds me of Nioh 1 and Dark Souls 2. Encounters are unfair when everything is hard to kill or stagger and could kill you in two hits ,some level design seems like a death of inspiration with mini-bosses everywhere reused as elite enemies and all the ""weaker"" enemies rather faking death or hiding at the corners.

This is FromSoftware's magnum opus no doubt, and holds the new place for top open world game of all time. I love that it isn't hand-holdy and respects the player enough to let them just play the game instead of chasing objectives and map markers, this was a huge concern of mine when I found out the souls formula was being adapted to open world.

"Mar 15, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"Nur vorweg: Für eine volle Review von Elden Ring, reichen 5000 Zeichen nicht aus. Daher gehe ich hier nur auf die meiner Meinung nach wichtigsten Punkte ein.

Der Großteil des Spiels, also der Teil der nicht aus den Hauptbosskämpfen besteht, gefällt mir sehr gut. Die Erkundung der Spielwelt ist jederzeit ein gefährliches aber lukratives Abenteuer und man findet an jeder ecke irgendwas. Auch den obligatorischen Wasserfall mit der versteckten Höhle kann man finden. Die Landschaften an sich sind sehr schön dargestellt, grafisch kann das Spiel allerdings nicht mit dem Demons Souls Remake mithalten. Es wurde stark auf Partikeleffekte gesetzt, Texturen und Charaktermodelle wurden an manchen Stellen aber ausgelassen. Mein liebstes Beispiel ist hier Patches, da dieser in beiden Spielen vorkommt.
Die Kampfmechaniken sind ziemlich genau so, wie in Dark Souls 3, nur dass die Waffenspeziefischen Spezialangriffe nun durch die Kriegsaschen ausgetauscht werden können und man nun Sprungangriffe durchführen kann. Außerdem ist es nun möglich, Geister für die Unterstützung im Kampf zu beschwören. Dabei hat man eine große Auswahl, die allerdings fast immer bestimmten Gegnertypen im Spiel entspricht. Man kann zum Beispiel eine kleine Skelettmiliz, eine Qualle(nicht zu unterschätzen) oder ein 3er Wolfsrudel beschwören, um mal die Anfänglichen zu nennen. Wie auch die geistigen Vorgänger, ist Elden Ring kein leichtes Spiel. Allerdings finde ich es falsch, die Souls Spiele von From Software immer nur als Schwer darzustellen, denn das sind sie nicht unbedingt. Sie sind knackig, ja. Allerdings kann man sich durch das erfarmen von Runen das Leben sehr erleichtern. Die richtige Planung sowie das ein oder andere Waffenupgrade können dabei auch eine Skilllücke schließen, wenn es einem dann doch zu schwer wird. Und in Elden Ring ist das, aufgrund seiner offenen Welt wesentlich einfacher als noch in den Vorgängern.
Was mich allerdings sowohl an Elden Ring als auch an den Vorgängern stört, sind die Bosskämpfe. Diese bestehen, anders als in Demons Souls, immer aus dem selben Muster. Man kommt in eine große offensichtliche Bossarena und macht im Prinzip nichts anderes als Rollen, Rollen, Zuschlagen und Rollen. Jeder Boss hat zwar seine eigenen Angriffsmuster, allerdings bleibt dieses Grundprinzip aus Ausweichen spammen und bei Öffnungen zuschlagen immer gleich(bis auf ein Beispiel, auf das ich gleich komme). Die Gegner haben dabei auch Ihre Resistenzen und Schwächen, die Schwächen machen allerdings nicht so viel Unterschied, wie man es sich wünschen würde. Bei Mini- bzw. Nebenbossen sieht das ganze anders aus, denn für diese braucht man teilweise bestimmte Waffentypen oder Angriffsmanöver um das Ruder rumzureißen. Die Bosse sind zwar immer schön in Szene gesetzt, dass aber kaum einer einen nennenswerten Twist hat, ist schade und teilweise sogar nervig. Erfrischend war hier ein Kampf zu Beginn des Spiel, in dem der ""Boss"" von ihren Scherginnen durch einen Schild beschützt wurde und man dem ""Boss"" nur schaden zufügen konnte, wenn man die Schildscherginnen aus der Masse findet und besiegt. Solche Kämpfe würde ich mir häufiger wünschen. Das Problem hierbei war allerdings, dass das nur die erste Phase war und der Boss danach wieder zu einem Rollfest wurde. Allgemein würde ich mir mehr Bosse nach Vorlage von Demons Souls wünschen. Eine Riesenspinne die einen Tunnel versperrt oder einen riesigen Drachen, für den man zuerst die umliegenden Ballisten abfeuern muss um ihn zu besiegen, sucht man hier vergeblich. Das Design und die allgemeine Aufmachung ist zwar immer beeindruckend und imposant, der Kampf an sich ist aber durch das immer gleiche Muster öde. Auch viele Gegnertypen wurden aus der Dark Souls Reihe kurzer Hand Recycelt. Bei Skeletten und Zombies ist das eine Sache, denn die kommen in fast allen Spielen dieser Art vor. Die DS eigenen Schleimklumpen und Frösche allerdings, sind 1:1 übernommen worden, genauso wie die Riesenkrabben.

Über die Performance kann ich mich persönlich nicht beschweren. Auf der PS5 merkt man zwar stellenweise die Bildrateneinbrüche, dies wird aber durch den Motion Blur gut kaschiert und ist mir nur selten störend aufgefallen. Allerdings nur im Performance Modus. Im Qualitätsmodus ist die Bildrate merklich ungeeignet für diese Art von Spiel, was aber auch zu erwarten war.

Alles in allem bleibt Elden Ring damit aber trotzdem ein gutes Spiel. Auch wenn die Bosse keine Highlights sind(was sie eigentlich sein sollten), weiß die Spielwelt und das Design durchaus zu überzeugen.",3,4
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"The last time I felt this way about a game was when the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim came out- I was nine years old.    Every day when I leave work, I have a smile on my face. I enjoy the drive home just a little more, because when I get home, I feel like a kid again. Past every cave opening, across every ridge, a small piece of adventure is waiting.    Every other game feels like a child's game compared to Elden Ring. Other games feature simplistic combat that is mastered in minutes, they spell out their story so you don't have to pay attention, they give you a big red arrow telling you what to do next.    Elden Ring doesn't do that, it roovides you a vast open world, dense with personality, and tells you ""go kill some ****",3,4
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I have played the game now for about 30 hours and explored the lands between. I can only say that this game has definitely earned its place in the upper ranks.

The map is huge. Especially if you compare it to other Souls games. There is something to explore in every single corner. And some of the coolest items are hidden.
Still it is a Souls game and it is hard, especially if you never played one before. I myself havent played a Souls game past the original Dark Souls. Just dipped a bit into Dark Souls 3 on my brothers PC and also played Sekiro.

I must say, From Soft really did  great job combining all they learned from previous games into this and it is the best version of them all in my opinion.
The story is told in the classic Souls way through items and conversations with NPCs. There is a red string you can follow, but its your decision how to follow it.

Still, the PC port is not fully optimized and you get a few stutters as well as 60 fps max. That would be a reason for me to only give 8/10 points, but in regards to wht I have read from people giving this game 0 points I think its only fair to pump the score higher.",3,4
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Felt the need to create an account just to review this amazing game. If you enjoy the souls franchise, you are going to at least enjoy this game, if you enjoy the souls franchise as well as any open world titles, you are going to love this game. Unlike some.... other... open world titles, elden ring is full of so much content that the open world is genuinely justified. You cannot go five minutes of exploration without finding something new. Bosses, dungeons, npcs, etc. Not only that, but everything feels incredibly hand crafted.i haven't encountered a single location that simply feels like filler that was added to make the map larger. The world building is unimaginably deep if you actually manage to follow along, and the combat is impeccable; as you would expect from a souls game. It does enough to feel fresh without changing the formula to an egregious degree. Additionally the art style is breathtaking despite the graphics being somewhat mediocre. Really, everything about this game is fantastic. Mosy of all, it's fun. Which is exactly what a video game should be.With that being said, the game is not without flaw. The biggest issue for me is performance(on a pc port). Now, when I say biggest issue, I do not mean that this is a big issue. Merely that it is the only one noticeable enough for me to mention it. I have a fairly decent setup and I will occasionally see a few frame drops as well as two or three hard crashes in the 70 hours I have played. Is it anything major enough for me to detract any points? Not at all, but if you have a lower end pc, I would perhaps wait for a few patches to drop. Another thing. I view this game as a masterpiece, but you may not. If you do not like the souls franchise, do not buy this game. It is still a souls game at the core and it is unlikely that your view on the game play will change. If you are a newcomer, I would still recommend this game, but I also reccomend that you hesitate. This is not an easy game. It is a fair challenge and you will die. A lot. The greatest part about this game is not the challenge itself, but the feeling of overcoming that challenge.q additionally, the story is not exactly linear. Do not expect red dead redemption style cutscenes. Much of the story must be uncovered by yourself through speaking to easy to miss npcs and keeping a watchful eye to the open world. You may even finish the game with almost no idea of what happened before your character came into existence. If you take these two details into account and neither sounds like a deal breaker, I must HIGHLY reccomend this game. Now. Review over. I am going to play elden ring.",3,4
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,It’s literally the best game I’ve ever played. The combat required skill but the learning curve is not too steep. The map feels densely packed but not with uninteresting pointless things. There’s always something to do and somewhere to go. With already 50 hours in this game I’m no where near completing it. Without the side quests and side dungeons I would say this game takes about 60-70 hours to complete on a first play through however the side quests feel like the meat and potatoes of this game and I often find myself being more interested in them than following the main path.,3,4
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I never felt the need to write a review on Metacritic before. I was perfectly content watching other opinions roll in and keeping mine to myself.

I am a self proclaimed Baby who is Bad at Video Games and I only ever play things on easy mode. I had an interest in other Fromsoft games like Bloodborne and Sekiro but they were way too difficult/intimidating for me. My go to game to hyper fixate on is usually one of the Dragon Age game and I'm so thankful I can play on baby mode and mod it to make it even easier (skip the Fade anyone?).

With all this being said, this is the most fun I've had since experiencing DAO for the first time. I wish I could properly explain it but it's really the first open world game that really does feel like an open world. excessive map markers give me Weird Anxiety and whenever a game is pushing me to go one way I always do the opposite because I want to explore. There really is no ""opposite"" in Elden Ring aside from NOT following the Grace Arrows. Whenever I discover a ruin or dungeon I feel wildly giddy because even though there's some topography calling attention to it on the map it really DOES feel like I discovered it because there was nothing telling me to go there.

Or merchants!! Riding around and finding a new merchant is something so fun because they really can be tucked away in little place with no indication that they're there. I'm about 50 hours in and still haven't left the first region because I'm still discovering little nooks and crannies I missed.

I've never played a game that's made me literally jump off the couch celebrating after I clear a boss on my first try; or makes me THIS TENSE and still somehow turns it into an enjoyable experience. The way combat works has really forced me to slow down and THINK and not just try to over level my guy to an obscene amount.

It's definitely not a game for everyone, and there's a learning curve when compared to the action adventure RPGs I normally play, but it's definitely the game for me and maybe other people like me.",3,4
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,This is the perfect game honestly. It's the game that Horizon Forbidden West wishes it could be! At least the devs are way better human beings than the devs for some other games right now. Thank you Fromsoft.,3,4
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"I’m a regular person playing this game. I’ve never rated a game on this website and I thought I would do so with this one. This is by far the least accessible souls I’ve played out of all the soulstitles. I’ll say the pros. The pros are the visuals, the music throughout the game, the combat system, and more. But bro , the boss battles are so stupidly implemented with one shot mechanics and unavoidable randomized attacks. I’m currently on the last boss, I have completed the game up to that point and I would never recommend this game to a newcomer or a friend trying to get into the series. Even for me somebody who has beaten all the souls games in the past, the bosses on this game are on a different level compared to past souls entries. I would say if you’re playing the game in terms of starting to mid level you’re going to have a great time. But close to endgame types of bosses, you’re going to spend countless hours due to one shot mechanics that even at high vigor will not save you from unless you overlevel which I feel should not be needed for these types of games because it feels cheap. I feel that the difficulty of these late bosses are implemented so poorly that I feel a number of people will give up due to their cheap mechanics. This game is just good at the beginning but late game is so terrible with these fights and I don’t know why they think good gameplay should include one shot mechanics and randomized unavoidable attacks that take so many hours to master.",10,14
"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"This the perfect version of Dark Souls as far as gameplay is concerned. Lots of systems that didn’t quite work in the previous games now make perfect sense. Exploration is continually rewarded. Boss fights are challenging and just like people wanted them to be.

The problem is really me, I’m not most people. In fact, I’m downright weird. Which in this case means I actually played these torturous games – Demon’s Souls, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro – not for the challenge, but for their worldbuilding, their characters, in short, the stories they had to tell.

Don’t get me wrong. All of that is still there. But it’s buried underneath dozens of hours of exploration and venturing into mini-dungeons.

These are, in theory, well-designed. After all, all of them are handcrafted. They aren’t procedurally generated Chalice Dungeons like in Bloodborne. Some of them even have lore significance. But most of them have very little in the way of that upon closer examination.

Oh, you’ll be amply rewarded for going in and clearing out the baddies. This is not like Breath of the Wild where you get the same orb 100 times. But see, I’m just not the type of person who cares. And that’s where my issue is with this game. Exploring the open world is required so you can level up and defeat the real bosses of the main quest.

I’d rather not. The ratio of “just another item I won’t use because I already got the Heater Shield and Longsword at the start” to discovery of important locations and encounters with actually interesting characters is about 5:1, being very generous.

Note that I did not finish this game, and I think that that’s unreasonable to expect of a single human being. But I did put 40 hours into it and reached the capital, thoroughly underleveled. I’m dropping it now, even though it hurts to never see the development of all these characters go anywhere.

I know that for lots of people, this’ll be a 10/10 experience. Just not for freaks like me, sorry to say. And as you’re probably also one of those, don’t buy this game. It’s not worth it for you. And I know I’m talking to one of you because you actually read my entire thing. Toodles.",10,14

"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"1. A boring repetitive empty giant open world. Generic and recycled bosses and enemies;2. The same old-style FromSoftware way of telling a story: a boring puzzle that has to be solved through reading hundreds of items descriptions and cryptic conversations with stoned NPCs;3. Clunky combat system and light-speed bosses from Tekken: rolling through infinite AoE attack combos just to land one or two strikes, repeat;4. Few pieces of equipment and terrible drop rates. You kill a boss just to receive some useless material;5. Very beautiful art direction, BUT terrible graphics;6. Poor performance;7. Different from Dark Souls, and the others, Elden Ring is mediocre at building tension. Dark Souls is a game that has you always under pressure, theres is little to no rest. You can only feel safe when you're resting at a bonfire. When you play for the first time, you never know what to expect. Enemies are strategically placed, as well as traps. And they're everywhere, all the time. Elden Ring can't do this. There are long pauses to ""commune with nature"", because the big empty open world is not threatening. You can see the enemies from distance, and you're never caught by surprise. The way from Ruin A to Ruin B is safe and sound... And once you approach Ruin B, you know ""ok, now I'll face some challenge"", at this moment, there's no tension, it was ruined by the anticipation. You always know what to expect and when;8. Multiplayer is the same old song: dependant on consumable items and limited to smoke walls. FS could have delivered a true multiplayer, but they are too addicted to the same old colorful phantoms paradigma.Am I saying the game is not good? No, I'm not. I'm just convicted that Elden Ring is far from being the Eight World Wonder that media wants it to be. Way too far from 97 on Metacritic. In my opinion, the worst among it's siblings.",5,7
"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"I wish I hadn't seen any reviews prior to playing the game, as I think it has left me disappointed.

The reviews got me to expect a transcendence. Like going from Final Fantasy 6 to 7, or Fallout 2 to 3. What I found was a good game. Better than average to be sure, but not what I was hoping for. I am lacking in fun. Right now the drive to beat it keeping me going, but I am not finding myself going, ""Wow that was fun."" There are many things the game does well, and I think it is fantastic for the souls community, but I think it lack appeal to the non-souls community.

I don't regret buying it, and I think I will beat it, but if you are on the fence, I may hold off. If you enjoy Souls, you are in for a treat.",7,10
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"An open world game must sacrifice some aspects due to the sheer size of the world they're creating. Unfortunately, much of what made the Dark Souls series so good has been lost or greatly reduced. Intricate, well thought out level design is now rare. Most of the various dungeons, castles, mines, and other environments are pretty straight forward.

Enemy and boss design seems to have suffered as well. Almost every minor boss is fought numerous times, which kills any sort of uniqueness they had.
Also, it feels like the developers are constantly trying to one up themselves. Every major boss has to have an over the top moveset that does a million damage, particle effects, and soundtrack. I am not asking for an easy mode, but I am asking for some competent game design.

Overall, it's fine. The first 20 hours are great, but the rest gets tedious. To see such a great developer make a game filled with baffling and outright bad design choice, makes me unable to go above a 7/10.",9,13
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,It's a beautiful game with awesome areas and cool enemies but imo the combat is crap. It's slow and clunky and mostly its just dying a bunch until you understand the enemy patterns and there's alot of recycled bosses as well. Don't get me wrong It's a good game just completely overrated. It's absolutely no where near a 10,9,13
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"I'm aware that most people that gave this game a 10/10 are fanboys all the way. It's just not reasonable, even more, if you played the games that came this month alone (Sifu, Horizon) u just can't nail a 10/10 on this game, is unfair for the rest of the developers that put a lot of effort into their products. Sifu had way smoother gameplay and animations and Horizon feels like it is 5 years in advance in terms of visuals, the difference is gigantic. So what I think the game did good and bad:

Good:
+ World design
+ Exploration
+ Art design
+ Variety of enemies in the world
+ And let's say the level design

Bad:
- Graphics (textures, lighting, shadows, etc, feels like a 2014 title, not 2022 one)
- Voice acting, mocap, lip-sync (insanely bad for a AAA developer)
- Story (super generic, vague, diluted, the dialogs and characters are super cringe)
- Clunky controls
- Animations
- Sound effects (again super generic)
- 60Hz cap?? in 2022?
- Optimization, stuttering (for pc at least and for now, maybe it will be fixed with a patch)",11,16
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"This game is not a masterpiece this game is not a 10 out of 10. The one thing that this game is definitively is overhyped. I have spent about 60 hrs playing and I will say I have enjoyed myself a good majority of that time, but there are a lot of glaring issues that are present in Elden Ring. I understand that some people really did not like the linearity of the souls archetype of games, and when meeting a hard boss it was more frustrating than fun to beat your head against the wall until something gave. To circumvent that issue they implemented open world which means you can go somewhere else and come back at any given point in time which is cool on paper! This would be fine IF the world itself didn't feel empty for the most part. Sure you have some cool locations scattered throughout the world that are really awesome experiences, but at some point you forgo exploring for just finding the nearest grace and teleporting around because you instinctively realize that there isn't much to do between point A and B unless you consider collecting another erdleaf a grand time. The biggest problem that I personally have with the game is that the sense of achievement is largely dulled when it comes to defeating a hard boss. You fight so many bosses at every twist and turn and sure some of them are harder than others, but they are so littered throughout every point in the game that eventually it just becomes a slog to get through. You want to get to this checkpoint, well here fight this boss first, you want to get to a new area, Well F you take this boss instead! There's no build up no tension it just becomes routine. When you get to a main area with a main boss thats where the game to me really takes over and shines. In those moments I really found myself having a real joy, but sadly due to open world aspect of the game the developers focused on making the world cohesive instead of the experience of being in the actual main areas itself. Overall it's a good game It has some moments that really make you enjoy it all but sadly mired with a rather mediocre open world and plague of bosses that make you feel more tired than exhilarated once defeating them.",11,16

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"I find this game is much overrated. each from software game before was better. most enemy are just ridiculous or just overpowered, nothing between. Open World is full of Nothing but the same houses, the same trees and the same graveyards. Dungeon design just got worse",8,12
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"This is basically Dark Souls 3 in an open world.
All mechanics are the same, i.e. outdated.
Sekiro was a good step forward: deflections, ""hesitation is defeat"" and so on - great game, 9-10/10.
People had high expectation, Mr. Miyazaki said that ER gotta show good graphics to keep up with Demon's Souls remaster, and he delivered.
But graphics and level design are everything this game has to offer, sadly.
I also suspect that story will unfold in an unexpected and exciting way. But it's hard to just sit there and play when gameplay is exactly what you've experienced 6 years ago.

Speaking of open world - it simply doesn't work. It's empty, 95% of it is just decoration. It's okay with me, as I said - level design (emphasis on ""design"") is good. But you find yourself riding a horse 90% of the time trying to explore a world that has little to offer - some loot, various mobs and occasional NPCs, mostly merchants. There are a lot of ""bonfires"" that connect together a dull emptiness of the game world.

I rate it 5/10 for labor being done properly but without any imagination regarding game design.

Horse is overpowered. Just ride in circles + L1/R1",8,12
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"I love Soulslike games, but my expectations for Elden Ring were low from the start. Souls and Open World, does it work? Well, unfortunately not for me.

What I like about Soulslikes is the intense combat, the danger that can lurk around every corner. In Elden Ring we can already see the opponents from afar, we can easily walk around them and even if they see us, we can flee in a flash with our mount. Only in the dungeons there is a bit of atmosphere, unfortunately they are designed quite repetitive and mostly have bosses that are not worth remembering.

The open world itself is pretty boring in my opinion, there's a lot of idleness. Sure, you might say now, just ignore the optional areas. But that's not really possible, because every now and then there are more or less useful rewards waiting for you. So like any other Ubisoft game, it often feels like work here too. I scour the entire open world, putting in several hours to MAYBE find a better weapon, armor, or spell. Most of the time, however, it were items that didn't fit my build at all, which only made the disappointment even greater.

I don't even want to start with crafting. Collect plants and hunt animals to make arrows? This might be fun for the first five minutes, but eventually you just roll your eyes when you run out of arrows. Luckily, you can later buy these from merchants and don't have to waste time farming.

Elden Ring is not a total disaster. In its core disciplines, it is just as much fun as the previous titles. Only the open world makes the game too easy and fills it with too much idleness and boredom.

Personally, I would like FromSoftware to go back to the menacing, atmospheric, yet rewardingly explorable and well designed linear levels.

Oh, and a new setting would be very refreshing, I don't really need a Dark Souls 5.",8,12
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"I don't get the hype behind this game. The whole self torture thing aside it is boring, meh graphics (PS5 4K TV), and poor controls. A 7 may be a little generous.",6,9
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"Elden Ring is a good game, but it has its share of problems.  While playing 100+ hours I've experienced some outstanding highs and lows.  I don't think its Fromsoftware's best title but I think its worth a play. Random ramblings to follow:

- art direction is awesome but graphically the engine is really showing its age which is a shame.  there is only a single directional light for shadows (usually the sun) and the lighting model is no where near the bar for todays next gen games

- speaking about the engine, it suffers from performance problems where frame rate tanks during load ins and poor pop in where you can see things like grass and other details be placed in the world spread out over a few frames

- design wise the open world mixed with dungeons is a new take which I enjoyed.  It was something new.  I still prefer the original Dark Souls design as I think it was the purist design but this is something new and I am ok with it.

- the first half of the game things are exciting and interesting, but like most open world games, things get repetitive after that.  it becomes a repeat of the same dungeons, the same bosses over and over.  by then your character is also pretty much setup so there is little reason to continue.  the story is nonsense so that is not a motivator

- there are real, real problems with how this design has influenced multiplayer.  Coop is fine, but invasions are completely broken.  They are essentially 3 vs 1 gank squads where the invader has a near zero chance at winning.  To win, the invader needs to rely on cheap tactics, luck, or play against someone not very good at the game.  When the invader does win it never feels satisfying. Gone are the intense PVP battles from other titles, or the adrenalin rush when someone invades your game.   This game played it very safe when it comes to multiplayer and loses one of the core things that make souls games exciting which is very unfortunate. PVP is also very unbalanced, but I don't think really any of Fromsoftware's titles have been so this is not a shocker.  But this one does feel the worst as magic and art of war skills are extremely OP.

- boss battles are very much a mixed bag.  They are better than other titles where you simply try to get behind an enemy and wack its ankles over and over but there are some choices that really do take away from the enjoyment.  Every boss has extra delays in the attack animations put in purposely to throw you off.  I get it, and I think that is ok for some, but its like that in every fight.  Bosses will take to the air in and arial attack and defy gravity for a split second just to make it more difficult.  Too much anime for my taste.

- Combat suffers from a general lack of polish and laziness from Fromsoftware.  Enemies will attack straight through walls as if they don't exist.  Many times, you might not even be able to see an attack coming because it was through a pillar.  Its feels incredibly lazy not to add a line of sight check and creates an unfair bad feeling.  Bad feeling moments crops up in many places throughout the game.  For example, during one boss fight due to a bug with the character movement code, I kept getting stuck on a tiny step in the environment while trying to run or roll that would allow the boss to kill me (it only takes 1-2 hits from a boss to kill you which is another thing). There is a bunch of jank that should have been found and fixed in QA or by now being how many games Fromsoftware has made in this style by now.  The player should feel like they lost due to a mistake they made, not due to lack of polish in the game's systems or a bug.  As a game developer myself, I am surprised with how much Fromsoftware can get away with.  This is essentially the same combat and physics system they had dating back to the original Demon Souls.

Anyway, its still a good game but I am slightly disappointed.  The sense of scale and exploration is awesome but these issues tarnish a really good game.  The mishandling of the PVP design was the nail in the coffin for me.  Without a solid PVP design I have little motivation to put in anymore time in to this game.",6,9
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"I have been playing since the release date. Initially, I enjoyed exploring the open world; it was thrilling, and I appreciated the creativity. But after some time, it feels lonely and repetitive, and you don't know where to go. And the cherry on top, the same cat boss three times in three different dungeons. Come on from-software have some creativity in different bosses: very confusing upgrade mechanics and no information about the recommended level to defeat an enemy or boss.

"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"In both a positive and negative way I got what I expected from Elden Ring . The by the numbers open world feels like a loading screen between places you actually want to be in , the exploration is mostly pointless due to the constant asset flip bosses and dungeons with slight gimmick changes , quests are impossible without a guide and the samey story is incoherent even by Souls standards . Most boss fights are nothing but a war of attrition as they task you with punishing a dude's one unsafe move that comes somewhere in between their aoe spazzing every 20s or so rinse and repeat only for you to die in the 42nd attempt due to their 2 billion HP...Unless of course you grind your balls off , use meta or cheese with the mimic which have all somehow become acceptable even if they were considered heresy in the past . Lastly the game commits virtually ever sin Dark Souls 2 was crucified for a 100 times worse .

Despite it's flaws and even if it is mostly a retread of past ideas Elden Ring is still a good game . A masterpiece though? Maybe if you absolutely LOVE these games or you have incredibly low expectations for AAA releases in general",4,6

The reason I've given it a 7/10 is because of the performance issues. Framerate is extremely unstable on the PS5 version and the pop-in is a nightmare. While the game is still playable, it feels extremely unpolished on a technical level and makes me wonder how they thought it was okay to release in this condition. I know many others are having the same issues and if you're wanting more information on what I mean, watch the Digital Foundry video that analyzes the game's performance on consoles.

While I have only had the game for a couple days I've already put roughly 40 hours into the game and there still feels like there is a ton left to complete.

There has been a ton of QOL changes and new additions which makes the game better and arguably easier than previous titles. HOWEVER, there is still plenty of amazing, challenging, and fun bosses all over. I don't know the exact number but I'm already about 60 bosses in and while some are basic bosses a lot are really cool.

I've been playing on a midtier PC that I bought last Black Friday and I haven't had any real issues with the game frame rate or lag. I am only playing on medium settings though because I don't want to nuke my pc since it's really nothing special lol

While the majority of the game isn't really too difficult there are some bosses that may take a while to beat.

Elden ring is the latest title from software, known for a series called “Dark souls”. Dark souls is an RPG with super tight level design built to test the player’s skill while providing a fantastic atmosphere and a unique way to tell a story through item descriptions and vague NPC interactions. So successful that it has spawned its own genre named “souls-like”.Elden ring, is an open world spiritual successor, taking place in an open world made by none other than G.R.R Martin, the author of game of thrones.

The idea of combining an open world with the unique souls-like genre by the legends themselves sounds too good to be true. The hype leading up to this game has been beyond comprehensible with the metacritic’s critic score currently being a 97 - among the highest scores ever.

The world of “the in between” is beautiful. It uses elevated and vertical space to truly capture stunning visuals. The graphics themselves is varying on a scale of “Okay” to “Good”, it lacks small things like plant physics and great looking textures, but it manages to for the most part run at a solid 60 fps, with a few exceptions dropping below but never below 40-50 and never so bad it stutters.

Sadly, the world itself isn’t very fun to explore due to feeling “copy pasted”.  The ruins all look the same, a handful of ruined buildings, a handful of enemies, and sometimes a tomb leading down to a tomb with a chest or a boss. The chapel often contains a key item, and a checkpoint that doubles as a fast travel point. The enemy camps vary in size and contain a few chests and a few enemies. Castles, caves, and mines are often the more exciting ones, often ending with a boss and some sweet loot to enhance your weapons. They often reward an item called Gold runes, which when used gives you a currency that  The game, which heavily focuses on exploration, does not automatically track what you’ve explored and if you’ve missed something, making it extremely confusing if you miss or don't remember where you found something.

The open world also comes with a few drawbacks. Mainly, in terms of difficulty. The souls games are known for their difficulty, often being fair and equipping the player by slowly ramping up the already hard difficulty. Elden ring, however, is a lot more open, which can lead players being lost and easily getting too much water over their head, leading to frustration as the game’s only vague hint is to “find the castle” , and your only means of doing so is to follow the vague direction you get when you visit a check point. The “Legacy dungeons” are the only parts of the game that truly has the old fantastic level design of the other games, making them a treat and the overworld feel rather boring to traverse. You always have fun in the dungeons, but you only have fun less than half the time you’re in the overworld, which is most of the game, which makes me miss the old formula.

To make traveling less of a hassle, they add a jump button, a mount, fast travel, and a much welcome “checkpoint” before most bosses. The controls are a bit clumsy and takes a while to get the hang of, and sometimes requires you to think twice which can be frustrating when you’re always in danger of dying. The buffer system seems milder than previous entries, but can still occasionally get you killed if you press too many buttons too fast causing you to lose control of your character.

The music in souls-like games are often just white noise such as birds, wind, and movement, which fits the atmosphere they’re trying to create. But once a boss appears, the music does a 180 and pumps out some great boss music making bosses truly feel special and magnificent.

Combat varies from great to not very enjoyable. You can customise your character just the way you like to play, with a huge arsenal of weapons, magic spells, and new to the series - special weapon abilities, which can be customised with your favourite weapon, creating quite a large number of styles. The game also speeds up the game with faster stamina regeneration (although making stamina less important), and a fast way to counter attack with your shield, making defensive play a lot faster.

It introduces Mounted combat, which ends up being jousting, or a game of cat and mouse, which changes and removes the deep satisfying combat into a…”run around the boss and swing until they do a big stomp and repeat”, which feels very underwhelming for a series with such a history with deep and satisfying combat.

Overall, I think the game takes 4 steps to the side,  but also two steps back. It experiments with the open world, but it feels like it’s missing the “from software polish” because it’s so big and vast instead of small, focused and concise.

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,Elden ring is a great game with amazing exploration and it was overall a good experience. There was lot of times where the boss AI would break and freeze or just stop attacking etc which was a bit odd and the only reason I am giving a 7 and not a 8 is because of some game breaking bugs which made me go back many hours on a 50 hour save file because of a soft lock bug which was known throughout the community.  Great game overall.,2,3
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"A maior vergonha da história dos vídeos games foi a ""mídia especializada"" atribuir nota 97 para um game com tantos problemas.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"Universe is inspired and the creative designers did a really good job. Sadly, what made the from software games what they are is lacking. Boss fights are unrewarding and feel like a chore to complete. Having completed all the souls game it is by far the worst entry in terms of boss fight. For about 90% of them Im falling asleep with my controller on my lap mechanically spamming the dodge button waiting for the 700 lbs guy to finish his acrobatic routine so that I can finally get a single hit in and then immediatly back away (rince and repeat about 20 times until he is dead). Gaming journalist need to stop taking from software as the holy grail of gaming, this game is good but giving it a 97% is false advertisement. User’s score is a lot more fair and reflecting of it. Ideas are good but execution is lacking.Overall it feels like everyone  that worked on this game loved making it and was passionate about it except for the people in charge of the combat.

The melee conbat is brilliant because of the depth it has and how many different weapons and Ashes of war to chose fromThe performance on the PS5 version I have been playing could be improved but doesn’t take away too much of my enjoyment.The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild set the mark for what an open world game should be and Elden Ring has built upon those stepping stones and improved upon it.

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"Elden ring is a great game I'll start by saying that however it is nowhere near the 10 out of 10 that the soy boy fan boys have the dark soul series tend to give it. If you're looking for an honest review from a person who actually hates dark souls games because of how unrelentingly difficult they are and inaccessible they are to the vast majority of gamers then you've reached the right place. I've put 35 hours of game time into Elden ring and I'm a pretty high level and have beat the 1st 2 major bosses including about 15 or 20 other Mini bosses and I'm here to tell you that Elden ring's overall combat And open world is amazing.. For a new gamer it definitely takes getting used to and you will die but Once you accept that it is a difficult mountain to climb with the satisfaction of standing at the top of the peak at the end of your grueling efforts you'll come to understand the beauty of the soul's franchise. Now I'll get into the major problem for me which keeps this at an 8 instead of the 10 that everyone seems to give it. This game is almost inaccessible for new players, when you're dropped into the world you don't understand anything and no cut scene made me care enough or gave me enough information to truly understand my purpose. I've played the game for 35 plus hours and still I do not understand what it means to be tarnished what the Lands between even are or why I am in pursuit of the Elden ring. The few and far between NP c's that you do meet have 0 lip syncing and are not presented in well choreographed cut scenes and also oftentimes speak gibberish or nonsense that is difficult to understand. On top of that seeing as you don't even have something as basic as a journal to help you you often times get vague representations of  Someplace far off in the distance with absolutely no true idea of where to go and because you have no quest book or log or journal of any type oftentimes the side quests that an NPC gives you are so difficult you end up having to go to YouTube instead of truly exploring the open world and finding the quest. Another thing I didn't like was the music you hear essentially the same score of music for your entire playthrough no matter what environment you go to or what part of the map you go to the music is the same thru and thru with the same track on repeat. And even with all of these problems even with the story being essentially an afterthought and and you essentially wandering around during around not knowing what to do I still find myself coming back to play this game hour after hour, Fight after fight, death after death, because the open world is on a skyrim level I'm level of discovery.  Around every corner, atop every mountain, across every plane there tends to be something no matter how small worthwhile a much needed item, a new ashes of war, a new spirit summon, or maybe just maybe you get a new weapon. Bosses are so unique and so challenging that regardless of these few flaws I've told you here today which most certainly keep this game away from the fabled 10 out of 10, it is by far a great game worth playing . I know most of this review might have scared you away but I want to be completely honest when I say there are flaws that most newcomers to the dark souls franchise will not like And will not be ready for, but if you can get past that there is so much greatness here And I for one won't be the person to stray you away from such a gem. Elden ring is a great game and is a lot of fun and is worth every penny",2,3
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Its is my first Dark Souls Type Game ever, i never managed to get into those type of games because of bad mindset but this time i said to myself if you are dying you are just learning how to beat a boss and it worked.

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"9.8/10 Is my actual rating, as there are some slight things that could be improved, &amp; no game is perfect.

First of all, the majority of ""0"" ratings are absurd, written by salty Horizon Forbidden West fans that their pandering ""let's just fill the game with anything but white men &amp; make any white men in the game weak or the bad guys"" pathetic excuse for a game isn't getting the shine now that Elden Ring is out.
I've also seen too many people giving this game a 0 &amp; then saying ""I've played about 5 hours"" ... Stop it. I won't even talk about people getting their ass kicked &amp; giving the game a 0.

This game is a masterpiece, it will win GOTY guaranteed, &amp; it'll be referred to as one of, if not the best game of all time.

I've currently played 100+ hours &amp; in the early stages I had more issues with how slow the pace was, but now that I'm far deeper into the game I'm glad nothing was rushed.

Elden Ring takes all the best elements of previous titles, &amp; even feels like it takes some inspiration from other games such as Dragons Dogma, &amp; blends them into the most cohesive, massive open world with the richest lore that I've ever played. Just when you think you've seen it all, there's another massive, detailed lore rich area to explore.
Boss fights are fantastic, with Radahn being one of my favourite fights so far. They can be absolutely brutal but it only adds to the scale &amp; importance of who they are in the games story.

There's a lot of twists &amp; turns in the game, a lot of areas that bring out emotion &amp; depth, &amp; the game is just a true masterpiece once you settle in &amp; really engage with it.

The minor gripes I have are that magic is way too overpowered right now, allowing certain scrubs to just flatline most bosses with very little effort, &amp; there's a shortcut to an end game area allowing people to massively overlevel which i hope they cut off. The games story can be a little bit slow, but the benefit of that is you really have to explore everywhere &amp; it gives you time to take more of the game in.

Do not take any review seriously that has a 0 &amp; says ""I've played less than 30 hours"" ... Or tries to talk about no quest logs, or other babifying features that we do NOT want in this game. There's a million other games with too much UI, &amp; too much hand holding... There's a reason this game is rated so highly, because it's as pure as a game can get while also being an absolute masterclass in world building.",2,3
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"This is a masterpiece, is not a perfect game, but miyazaki makes a great adventure that ever souls player will be enjoy. To the person who don't know about the souls games just take it easy, its hard but not too much.",2,3
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"The world is large, full of surprises, spells are cool, storyline is epic. If it weren't a FromSoftware game, I might give it a 8 or even 9.
BUT. Elden ring's combat system is a full disaster. After the success of Bloodborne and Sekiro, I can't believe FromSoftware is actually selling this defected, boring and somewhat unendurable combat system.

Skills are way more powerful than basic attacks and eventually melee weapons are nothing different from staffs, they are just skill casters. Weapon movesets don't matter at all because no one will use R1/R2 when L2 has larger range, higher damage and even faster speed. Without those broken skills/spells/ashes, our tarnished is basically nothing different from the ashen one in Souls 3, while the bosses has Bloodborne-level mobility. But with these skills, you can just beat any boss on the first try without even knowing what the boss does. I highly doubt that FromSoftware didn't really test the game thoroughly.

If FromSoftware really wanted the players to make use of skills in their fights, I am totally fine with that and I think it's a good change. There are a lot of ways to do this, they can let players equip many skills like spells, or merge skills into weapon's movesets, or even just allow players to use left hand weapon skills. Any change on the combat system accommodating the use of skills is good. But FromSoftware didn't change the skill system at all, not even a single bit, instead they just brutally dump in a bunch of overpowered skills and force players to use those skills or else suffer.

Not to mention how imba some skills are and how many bugs there are causing some weapons to be either OP or not playable at all.

They showed that they can make a good combat system in Bloodborne and Sekiro, but choose not to in Elden ring. This is what really disappoints me.",2,3
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,The game is near perfect… in most areas. There are definitely some enemies and quite a few bosses that are less than fun to encounter because they have long unpredictable attacks with very narrow and misleading openings during which you can attack. Also I very much dislike instances of non-player character interactions happening with no consent of the player. Exploring the map shouldn’t have a chance of holding your runes hostage because you wandered into an invasion you might not even know is possible with a lot of runes.The game does have compelling combat that gives genuine satisfaction when you defeat a hard enemy or boss! Even if they felt unfair you still feel so accomplished after you win on the first try or after dozens of deaths.The game is beautiful and rich with themes and flavor!The game is a 9/10 without the flawed enemy encounters mentioned above. An 8/10 with them. I would totally recommend it to anyone who can take many failures without losing faith.,2,3
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"Pros:- Huge world with incredible vistas- (probably) hundreds of dungeons- excellent graphics- very detailed and in-depth inventory, weapons, magic, items- Challenging but beatableCons:- Absolute bewilderment for first time players of a soulsborne game. Very little is explained, zero guidance on aims or what anything is or does- Controls are clunky and sometimes unresponsive.

If you like boss fights and getting killed over and over and over again until you learn the rhythm then go for it. The open world is cool at first but you quickly realise that it is completely absent of story and reason for being. You are only exploring so you can find a some stupid rubbish to add to your flask or slowly improve your stats. The game starts with a loose story structure and some guidance of where to go but within one hour you meet a boss that is really difficult. You then have no idea of what to do and just start walking around. I managed to defeat two side bosses and level up my character quite a bit. But in my 10 hours of wandering i never came across an interesting side story. Just lots of things to fight. - which quickly becomes really tedious.I’m giving it a 6 as I get why some people would love it.

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"I don't review many games as but given the high profile of this and that I have put over 30 hours in, I wanted to chime in.  I've never played a Souls game so this might be useful to someone who is intrigued by the stellar reviews.  I have played a ton of open world games.  I feel that we have two concepts that don't fully work together.  How can you champion exploration and experimentation when a brutal death (often with a steep cost) lies around every corner, many of them unavoidable the first time through?
In addition, the combat gameplay doesn't benefit the open world environment. Each enemy has different moves, meaning you can't use your past experiences with other enemies to help you against new ones.   Many enemies have unblockable kill moves that until you've experienced them multiple times, you won't be able to avoid.  Each foe is starting over, and the only way to learn is to die over and over.
It also feels like a single-player MMO.  Enemies sit around or follow simple patterns, and respawn constantly.  They lack any personality or real interaction.  It's super-gamey.
The world is super-moody and the boss design and animation is fantastic.  But this just isn't the RPG/Open world experience I enjoy.",9,14

But that is kinda the point in all of the fromsoftware games. if you want to know the lore you got to look for it yourself. people are also complaining that this game is just darksouls 4 with open world. thats right. if you don't like that, then this game is indeed not for you.

the only reason why this game is a 9 and not a 10 is because of the minor performance issues. sometimes the fps drops to 30. and the game is indeed not as beautiful as other ps5 titles like demon's souls. but for me personally that is not really an issue.",10,16
"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"I feel this game is incredible and an unpolished piece of **** at the same time.

Where the game shines, it does so beautifully in its wide range of gameplay styles, exciting boss fights, and well designed main dungeons.

The game however is EXTREMELY unpolished.

There's an early NPC which sets the entire early game story and direction which you can accidentally miss and have no idea what's going on. At the beginning of the game you're often beating dungeons and collecting items which you have no idea how to use and actually can't make use of yet, making the rewards feel very unfulfilling. There are a bunch of game mechanics that are hidden behind obscure optional texts, or random unmarked NPCs and you don't even get access to the nexus and most of those basic mechanics until like 6 or 7 hours into the game. Over 30 hours into the game, I still don't know how to use some basic mechanics like cooking.

Basic things like explaining new game mechanics, quest logs, comparing items to current items in the store, knowing when npcs have new things to say etc. are all missing. Again, these are lacks of basic game polish that deep gamer masochists treat as features, and most people used to modern games will find frustrating. That's not even mentioning the graphics. Which frankly feel like DS1 graphics which can run on a switch, yet this game has random visual bugs and performance issues all over the place on expensive hardware. DO NOT EXPECT A POLISHED GAME.

The game also suffers from a complete disconnect in tension. You go from being afraid of most enemies and having to work for everything, to being an untouchable speed demon on a horse a few hours in.
Now rather than having to sneak past, or fight enemies in the overworld to access the loot they're guarding, you can just ride around, pick up items with no pickup animation in super overleveled areas and gallop off on your merry way. The horse is OP OP.
So much so that there is actually a way to beat a lvl 80 boss, AND get enough exp to get to near lvl 50 as a lvl 1 scrub within an hour of starting the game, all without having to swing your weapon once!

Honestly some people might enjoy just riding around aimlessly on an open world copy paste landscape for hours on end on an untouchable horse for variable rewards, but that's just not for me.

This game got really fun for me when I stopped treating it like a polished game that I should experience in the way the devs intended, and started treating it like the broken piece of **** it is! I now go online to find the coolest builds, discover how the game mechanics work, figure out the most broken exploits, look up where the most broken items are, and do my upmost to become as much a god yet not too much of a god as possible.

The game is such that even with the ridiculous exploits, most bosses are still challenging, and you can kind of make the game as hard or as easy as you want by exploiting exp hacks. If you want to grind exp for an hour and become way stronger you can, if you want to spread your points so you can do all the builds yet still be the same combat strength, you can, and if you want to be a deep masochist and wander around for hours finding a few cool things, and grind ****ty mobs and bosses and be frustrated for hours and hours because it hurts so good, you can do that too!

This game is beautiful, hideous, amazing, poorly designed, with amazing design choices, with easy ass cheesable bosses, with riveting hard gaming challenges, with absurd exploits, and a lot of frustration and a lot of triumph.

So what are you waiting for?
This is the best game of the year!
It's also the worst game of the year!

Come check it out!",5,8
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"30 hours in and there is lots to like about this game. It is visually stunning and the creativity/world building is 10/10. The whole experience is not perfect though. The game play is nowhere near as enjoyable as God of War or Ghosts of Tsushima. It feels laborious - more like going to work than taking time off. It is a game built for masochists - those who love extreme challenge - both in skill and in solving puzzles. I'm not sure a casual gamer (without a guide or some Google searches) could get through this game. I can see why professional gamers and reviewers love this game, but anyone who can't commit full time will not.
I am not against the difficulty (I don't agree with not having a story mode) but a creator can do as they like, it is their world. It does take away from the experience though for many, including myself. I don't want to spend an hour unable to beat a boss only to give up and go farm runes for another couple of hours so my characters level matches my ability. The feeling of success is not worth it for me.
I am also dismayed at the little character customization that is available. I played the astrologer character. I would love more options for my weapons and gear, in 30 hours I've gotten two outfits that I can't make any meaningful customization too and I had to go find a mid game staff in some poisonous swamp to have any chance against bosses. Looking up astrologer outfits, the first cool one is about mid game which I'm guessing I will never see. If you like weapon and outfit choice, choose a melee character with lots of strength and endurance.
I beat both God of War and Ghosts of Tsushima - in both games I felt god-like. I felt strong and able. I do not feel this way with Elden Ring. I feel stressed, and overworked. The bit of a rush I got beating Pumpkin head or Margit was not worth the time I put in to do so.
The experience is worth seeing but unless you are a committed gamer, I'd suggest waiting for God of War Ragnarok. If you really want to try this game, give Bloodborne a quick try to see what playing at this type of difficulty feels like. I know for a fact that many will feel disappointment after buying this game without reading reviews.
The feeling when you beat a hard boss is great, but it is also awful if it ends the game for you because you simply cannot. Great game, that is not for the casual gamer. With GoW and GoT offering story modes/difficulty options, I am disappointed that this is not offered with Elden Ring considering how much money and time was put into this game.",5,8
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"I'm sure the game is fantastic, however I'm very disappointed and shocked by the absence of the choice of English as the game's language.
Understandably I bought the digital copy off of PS Store Taiwan, and Chinese is the primary language used there, but what about expats or foreigners that lives in Asia? We are left with an almost unplayable game. In a game world as rich and filled with lore such as this, I'm extremely saddened that I cannot enjoy it.

BandaiNamco/Sony, please consider patching in English. It's not that hard :)
I also don't really care about whatever this has to do with region or licensing, please respect your customers.",5,8
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"This is going to sound strange coming from me, a massive From Software fan who's been greatly looking forward to Elden Ring, but I actually have mixed feelings about this game.

I've put about 15 hours into the game so far, and I'm still mostly exploring the starting area, Limgrave, so perhaps there's much better content to see as you progress a bit further, or perhaps I'm just missing something. But, thus far, I have two main issues with the experience.

The first issue is that I feel like I lack any kind of specific, concrete, long-term goal. What exactly am I supposed to be working towards? All I've been told in-game is to somehow ""become an Elden Lord."" It's such a vague task however that I'm unable to wrap my head around how to specifically go about achieving it. What does becoming an Elden Lord entail? Who knows. I can assume it entails exploring further and further into the Lands Between and ultimately fighting a final boss, after which you may be presented with the opportunity to ""become an Elden Lord."" But this is ultimately a guess, and because the game doesn't give you this goal in concrete terms, it has made a lot of what I've done in the game so far feel very aimless and strangely pointless. It doesn't feel like I'm working towards anything specific, and therefore I feel almost disincentivized to engage with what seems to be the only activity the open world has yet to offer - fighting enemies.

Which brings me to my second issue - the content in the open world. I've explored Limgrave now for about 15 hours, as I've said. I haven't discovered a single interesting thing that wasn't in some way a fight. Where exactly is this wealth of content that every review claims is around every corner? I've discovered random boss encounters; these are pretty cool. I've discovered lots of small, medium, and large groups of enemies; these are generally less cool. Fighting enemies in Souls games has always been more about the macro reward - progression along a set, geographically linear (relatively) path that inches you closer and closer to some concrete objective - rather than fighting just for its own sake. But that's all it feels like I'm doing here. There are chests with various items in some enemy camps, but these have been pretty few so far, and the items contained within are typically just ""meh."" It feels like a lot of simply fighting for the sake of fighting, and that just doesn't constitute worthwhile and compelling content for an open world in my opinion, if that's all there is to do.

I hate to do it, but I'm going to compare this experience with that of Breath of the Wild, because tbh I can't play an open world game without at least subconsciously making this comparison every step of the way.

In Breath of the Wild, you're given a very simple and concrete objective right off the bat. ""Defeat Ganon."" It's so easy to understand. You're going to fight Ganon. It's going to be a physical battle. You know you're going to need to get stronger, you're going to need more health, more stamina, better gear, etc. Therefore, you can proceed with purpose, and every choice you make in the game can be contextualized, even when it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with defeating Ganon. Some things you'll do will feel directly tied to that goal, and other things won't feel related at all, but having that concrete goal gives purpose and context to your actions, and as a player you feel this, even if it's only subconsciously.

Secondly, there's just so much to do in Hyrule! Fighting enemies is just one activity among many, as opposed to the only real content around the open world. On my first play-through of BotW I actually ignored and avoided enemy groups frequently, because I was having so much fun just doing everything else. I felt like there was such a variety of content, and importantly, it was all so much fun to do, and a lot of it just for its own sake. Finding Koroks was an enjoyable activity that put a smile on my face, regardless of the reward you get for doing it. Fighting random pockets of enemies in Elden Ring is not really all that fun, and especially so when it doesn't have the needed context of a concrete goal or objective.

So, although I am enjoying Elden Ring to an extent, right now I fail to see how the open world is an asset to the Souls formula. I'm more inclined to say that it's a detriment, as it doesn't offer any real novelty in the way of content, and possibly distracts from the aspects of a Souls game that I find compelling. Like I said, I've explored Limgrave for about 15 hours now, and a lot of that time spent has felt aimless and unrewarding. I don't feel like I'm really progressing, because I don't have a concrete goal to work towards, and the content isn't necessarily all that fun or engaging for its own sake.

I hope my experience gets better and better as I play, that it eventually just ""clicks"" and really hooks me, but as of right now my feelings are mixed.",5,8
"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"I steered away from the Souls series for a long time despite the beautiful graphics and design, on account of the brutal reputation for difficulty they had. For this game, the marketing said that this game would finally be accessible to the average player.

That was a deliberate and sadistic bold faced lie through and through. I have played a fair distance into the game and put up with many challenges, but eventually there comes a point that expecting the player to have millisecond reaction timing to overcome superly one sided fights is absolutely disgusting in terms of the gameplay design. The pacing of the levelling up is terrible after the beginner areas. The distances between the save points to the hardest areas of the game are unnecessarily long. Bosses and challenge opponents will suddenly have unbalanced countering range and abilities that are unavailable to the player.

Overall, this game is a bait and switch for making content accessible to the wider audience. I agree with the many reviews on here that it entirely does not deserve the 10 out of 10 praise that so many are giving it. I acknowledge that so much of the content was beautifully created, but so much of it is locked behind a rage wall of gameplay.

Do not waste your money on a console version. There are beautiful designs and content to enjoy, but it would probably be done better on PC in order to install mods to level the playing field as long as you don't care about multiplayer.",5,8

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I could argue this being the best game ever made, and I would do it with the research and passion of a presidential debate...

I never, ever, thought it possible to have THIS complete of a gaming experience. When I say complete? I mean in the way of FromSoftware making a game that can satisfy every gaming itch you could have, and ones that you didn't even KNOW you have.

You want a game with a story and rich lore? This is it.

You want a game with fantastic customization options? Its here.

You want a huge open world that rewards exploration in every way? That is the best element of this game easily.

You want a game that's an ode to the trial-and-error Nintendo era without it being cheap? Look no further.

This game is not only the culmination of FromSoftware previous titles; It's a love letter to the entire history of gaming. They've achieved a level of momentum that I haven't seen since SquareSoft in the 90's. This studio knows what they are doing and they are masters of their craft, even as 3rd party developers. As a matter of fact, just give them all the ""Game of the Year"" awards right now because I am certain that no other game will get even close, not even the new God of War or any other triple-A title coming out this year.

It is a complete gaming experience that can NOT be missed by anyone that's passionate about gaming culture. FromSoft has set a standard and I can assure you that all of the greatest development studios are studying this game. You could put this game in the Library of Congress now, it's THAT good.",9,15
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"It's clear as hell that this game is a pure meta designed product from the bought reviews to the bought youtubers. It's basically a mash of all the assets and monsters of Dark souls 1-3, Bloodborne and Sekiro, packed up in a meta open world design that absolutely makes no sense for the designed difficulty. You never know if you are losing to a boss because you didn't explore enough or he was just easy because of that. All invasions are fked up, pvp is basically dead and even if not it's most of the time just 2 hit OP arts or magic. While you have 900 bosses it's basically like 30 that repeat itself again and again, as fire, ice, toxic, double bosses or all of that. All the dungeons almost look the same and quickly make no sense to explore since you are very limited in upgrade material. The game also runs like a dog FPS wise and eats inputs. The boss design is extremely flawed since you either get hit by a gimmick instant mechanic that has no visual feedback or you die to an one hit. Bosses onehit or twohit me all the time with over 60 Vigor and Heavy Armor, let that sink. Bosses regardless who never gave me a satisfaction for killing them like Sekiro did. Overall this game is not very outstanding in it's design and could quite honestly be a gigantic fanmade mod.",6,10
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"This game is definitely awesome, but has many flaws that ruin it. The boss fights are next level, the soundtrack is incredible, and the art style/ atmosphere really is a sight to behold. Even though these things are great there are tons of issues. The content in the world is copy pasted with not that much liveliness to it, (excluding the occasional dungeon in regards to copy and pasted). The world just feels dead overall. The issues with the framerate on  the current gen consoles is also frustrating. As for mechanics of the game there is nothing that makes it feel like it has been perfected or gotten better in any way. The combat and movement is still pretty clunky and janky. The tutorials are not helpful enough especially for players who are newcomers to the ""Souls"" type series. The menu and crafting system, and item use can be confusing as far as what the items do and what the purpose is. Compared to Sekiro's combat it feels like it is missing something. Also, sadly a lot of the same combat animations are used from Dark Souls 3. It just feels like the 10/10 ratings are all hype. I would say it is more likely in the 6/10 - 7/10 range. Although, that is just my opinion. The game just feels the exact same as all of the older FromSoftware titles including the older ones.

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"This is the first time I have felt compelled to review a game on this website specifically because I bought Elden Ring for 2 reasons: I love Fantasy RPGs, and the strength of its reviews. I bought this game upon release and have been playing it almost every day since then. I am an experienced gamer and would rate myself above average in terms of skill level, but I'm no Pro. I work full time and I have a life outside of work. I think I represent your average adult gamer whose free time is limited but still enjoys playing as a hobby. I also passed over two other nearly simultaneous big new releases because I chose this game.
Now, all of that being said: think carefully before purchasing this. I think that prior to Elden Ring's release, the difficulty of the game was downplayed specifically so as not to discourage people from buying it. This game will be EXTREMELY CHALLENGING for the casual gamer. Unless you are a gifted gamer, playing Elden Ring will require many, many hours in order to succeed. You may make 99 attempts at a boss before finally getting lucky and succeeding. Or you will spend hour upon hours searching out remote items in order to give you an edge. Often times it will feel like beating your head against a brick wall. Unless you enjoy playing games on the hardest difficulty setting (I don't!) then this game is not for you. And that fact is being obscured by overly-laudatory reviews and condescending fanboys who do not recognize or appreciate the amount of time it takes to make basic progress.
An additional deciding factor for me in the purchase of this game was the multiplayer. And let me tell you, multiplayer is a total blunder in Elden Ring. To start with, the process involved in joining your friends is unnecessarily complicated. And then, the game punishes you for playing together! Significantly reduced health potions, totally losing the ability to call your horse, no longer able to summon your pets (spirit wolves/jellyfish/etc), no ability to rest at the ""sites of grace"" to recharge your health/potions, AND THEN. Each and every single time you die, you will be separated from your friends and sent back to your home world to start the convoluted process of cooperating all over again. The multiplayer system is the single biggest fail Elden Ring can make claim to. I legitimately felt bad for convincing a friend to buy this game and play with me upon release, and I will not be recommending it to any others for this reason.
Now, after listing my complaints, I should at least, to some degree, acknowledge the game's strengths (although they are surely glorified in great detail by many other reviewers). The game is beautiful. A bit too perpetually dark, but beautiful nonetheless. Truly gorgeous (except all that ugly armor). Second, although it is completely a fantasy RPG, it still manages to be unique and original. This is not a cookie-cutter fantasy game. Character creation is another strength of Elden Ring's. I don't know about you, but I love customizing my characters, and their character customization is A+.
Finally, I will admit that the game still manages to be fun. That is, when you're not busy trying to stop yourself from throwing the controller at the TV, or from smashing it on the coffee table, or flipping off the ""YOU DIED"" screen for the ten thousandth time.  It is fun, but it is tiring and frustrating to a degree that potential buyers need to be aware of - a fact that I think was intentionally obscured by pre-release reviews, and is condescendingly dismissed by the ""get good"" groupies who, quite simply, have more free time than you probably do.",3,5
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"In the run-up, there was great enthusiasm, as none other than ""Game of Thrones"" author George RR Martin had co-written the story for the fantasy game.  What ""Elden Ring"" delivers is almost cheeky: A magic ring broke, evil monsters grabbed the fragments.  At least hobbits don't have to make their way...
The main plot of the game is clear, boring and predictable, George RR Martin's commitment (who only wrote the background story of the environment mentioned) was apparently little more than a PR stunt.

Anyone who has seen titles like ""Horizon Forbidden West"" or ""Halo Infinite"" will be disappointed with the graphics of ""Elden Ring"".  Textures are muddy, objects keep popping up instead of appearing smooth as you approach them, and the design of each region is more reminiscent of a game designed for the previous generation of hardware.

Anyone who likes to fail will love ""Elden Ring"".  The game punishes even small mistakes with brutal severity, while at the same time being stingy with tips and explanations.  So you have to work hard for each fight, start over and over again and blindly search for the optimal combination of tactics, equipment and timing in order to slay the many bosses.

Overall, ""Elden Ring"" is only for real hardcore gamers.  Anyone who likes to charge against the same monster twenty times will love the title.  Even fans of an open game world should definitely take a look at this game.  But one thing should be clear to everyone: ""Elden Ring"" is actually not a ""game"", but bitter seriousness.",3,5
"Mar 18, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,2,"This is by far the worst game I’ve played in 25 years. I am level 105 and put 80 hours into it. I’ve only played this long because I am stubborn and didn’t want to spend $60 on a game and not complete it.
Playing this game is like intentionally joining a multiplayer lobby full of hackers/aimbots in a game like call of duty. It’s an extremely unfair, frustrating and often futile experience. Do not play this, especially if you have anger issues. Also let’s not reward Sony and the multiple corrupt game journalists who gave this a 10/10. If you’re looking into this game because of the lore, be aware that it’s a bait-and-switch scheme. The lore is incoherent, badly explained, and the very rare NPCs you can interact with do not even move.

You should only buy this if you enjoy :
- Getting killed by almost every enemy in the game in 1-3 hits, no matter your level/armor (not exaggerating)
- Being forced to roll/dodge/block multiple combos from bosses before you can safely hit them a couple times, and repeat this 100 times because bosses have 30x your health.
- Unforgiving roll/i-frame timing, with zero reward for getting it right since almost every enemy attack is part of a combo that can change randomly
- Even more unforgiving timing for parrying, with a janky stagger to critical hit QTE which does not trigger half the time. Furthermore, it's not clear which attacks can be parried. I guess the devs expect you to die 50 times per boss to find out for yourself, seems to be their plan for pretty much everything in the game.
- Absolutely laughable collision models which will cause you to miss enemies that you literally can’t get any closer to (for example because their foot prevents you from getting close enough to hit their stomach)
- Dying to hits/slashes/strikes that missed you by 6+ feet (not exaggerating, i have multiple videos of that happening), or that have lingering hitboxes for 1 second or more, even on non-AoE attacks
- Balance that’s all over the place, you’ll constantly swing between thinking you’re overleveled, crushing everything in your path, and suddenly the difficulty level will explode, leaving zero room for error (and enjoy spending 1-2 minutes running back to most bosses between each attempts)
- Pathetic and confusing UI and ergonomics, especially when it comes to the map, menus and descriptions.

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I've just finished this game on the PS5.
Just like all FS games, this one is ruthless, it will be challenging to long time players and challenging to newcomers. Don't fret, though, please, this game presents you different ways to play, some easier than others and it can be like a puzzle sometimes to decide how to continue, with so many options and enemies that have different weaknesses, you might just need to find what works for the one you having difficulties.

Bosses aren't unfair, seriously, they are very predictable, the animations linger long enough to make it clear what will happen, and, again, like a puzzle you just need to discover the correct way to solve it, where to dodge, when to attack, all those are very important, and it is fine to take your time to explore the solutions until you find your own.

Most FS games aren't extremely linear, to begin with, but path choices were very conservative, so you could find yourself not able to continue in any avenue, but Elden Ring is open from the very early beginning, allowing you to explore many avenues to explore, you want to go to more difficult parts of the game and try getting loot to help you succeed in the early game? Sure, that's just fine! With so much great content, there will be other stuff to do at any point in the game, so if you are stuck, you can just try it a bit later, with a new weapon.

DS3 allowed you to relocate your skills (I sincerely don't remember that about the other FS games), but it was, sincerely, not in the best way possible, forcing you to spend hard to come by items (only a very small amount in the game, earned through PvP), which made it hard to change classes, for fear of not having enough to go back if necessary, however on Elden Ring they help you on you trying different approaches, giving a lot of items used for relocation. Through my playthrough, I was many different things, mage, samurai, Guts and that helped me defeat bosses I was having difficulties with, and it is great to change stuff around, try new things, I enjoyed that.

The graphics are great, it's not an FFVII remake, or Guardians of the Galaxy, but, sincerely, it is way bigger with much, much more content, a huge amount of weapons, armour, animations for attacks, bosses, enemies, I mean, it is crazy all this game has, and also, in my opinion, stuff is way more intricate, everywhere you look has something interesting or different worth of your attention, I think that it is fair for games with different scopes and focuses to have different graphics qualities.
That said, the graphics are not bad at all, they are a huge step from DS 3, not even close really, bosses I just died while admiring them. The art design went above and beyond,  there isn't a single place not telling a story through the architecture or current state of chaos/destruction. The small grass is kinda meh, but I particularly don't care for details that wouldn't add much to the kind of game Elden Ring is.

In my experience on the PS5 stutters can happen. However they are usually as soon as a huge open area is loaded, and then they stop, it never occurred to me in any of the dungeons, caves, forts, etc, I never died to any enemy thanks to it, it never lingered long enough for me to get to combat while it happened. That kind of stuff doesn't bother me, it is just while the game loads. That was only my experience on the PS5 though.

About the open world, in my first two hours or so I did think it was empty and had nothing to do. However, it was because I hadn't grasped yet the type of open-world it is. In BOTW you go to a high place and scan the surroundings to find new places to explore, in a lot of open-world games you climb something and then the map is revealed to you. Elden Ring is not like that, you need to be attentive, look out for caves and mines, you have to open the map and mark the places you suspect could be interesting, you need to talk to NPCs and try to find where they are leading you, things aren't hidden, but they aren't glaring and out of place, they exist on that world, and they feel like a part of the world, and you have to search for them. When you open your mind to the open-world style of Elden Ring, you understand how fantastic it is to go exploring, and that is innovative. The horse is not only for exploration, it adds a whole new depth to combat, where every weapon has different attacks and combos that are better for different types of enemies. So it was an amazing addition that is also innovative.

The story is there, and it is very deep. You go to a town and there are mad people and mad rats on a church with the scroll teaching an incantation that makes others mad. This one is easy to put together, but the whole game is like that, and it is the opposite of lazy, it is fantastic and genius. Try to understand the lore, it will surprise you.

Do play Elden Ring.",7,12

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Not usually a Souls fan, but this game man… it’s so good! Its way more accessible and isn’t over the top hard right out the gate. It’s still hard from the get go don’t get me wrong but it feels a little gentler at the beginning  than other FromSoftware games. The open world aspects also helps mitigate that classic frustrating loop of dying over and over again to the same thing. If something’s too hard you can go explore and do other things, then come back later once you’re stronger. Only complaint is the performance sometimes. Lots of stuttering. Other than that it’s amazing",12,21

Yeah, the graphics are not RDR2 level, but they don't need to be , and I think it would be bad for the game if it had hyperrealistic graphics with the type of content it presents.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,If you are a souls fan then this a must play game.The world is rich and beautiful and at the same time dangerous. The story is great too. The bosses are unique and are work of art. The new mechanics are great too.,4,7
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,Hard，Annoying，Smart map design ，Fulfillment from the chanllages. It's an ultimate Dark Soul like game. Needing a long time to adapt if you haven't touch Dark Soul like game.,4,7
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,I bought two copies of this game so I could play co-op with my sons. It has been fantastic.  I've played past Dark Souls games and they often ended in frustration when you got sick in a particular difficult boss. The open world is a great fit that allows you to do other things when you are stuck and continue to make progress and come back when you are ready.  There are some clunky things about the co-op but it is SO much better than earlier Souls games and with the sites of grace being more prolific it is much easier to coordinate and join each other. I love being able to use the horse to get around the world so much faster. While the mounted combat feels solid and well thought out rather than an after thought. There are several improvements that just make the game work better.  Even the summon system is a great way of helping a solo player compete in some of the harrier areas. It is also a visual masterpiece.  I've caught myself pausing several times to just take in the scenery and appreciate the artistry that is everywhere in the game.,4,7
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"So let’s break this game down to what it is. It is a soulsborne game, no doubt. It’s an open world game. Are these bad things? Absolutely not. FromSoftware has done something with this genre of games that not many other company’s have been able to do. They’ve injected life back into what was becoming a stagnant genre. And for those complaining that there isnt a story to the game, have you not played any other game of theirs? The story is meant to be found and put together throughout the games, instead of being handed to you. It is meant to be EXPLORED and delved into. And people complaining about the difficulty don’t seem to get it either. They don’t make games for people that like walking simulators. FromSoftware games are meant for those looking for a challenge. Much like Ninja Gaiden, these games are meant to test you and make you want to improve your skill. That is part of the allure of soulsborne games. And they also usually have some of, if not the best, boss battles of any games out there. The backstory bosses get in the games brings a whole new level to them whilst facing them. I mean, Artorias from Dark Souls was a tragic boss battle where you actually felt bad that you had to beat him, not to mention Sif. The same applies here to many, if not all the main bosses in the game. One specific boss is a two headed dragon that can only be described as an epic encounter. I literally got Ghidorah vibes with it as well as dark eater Midir. In closing, I just ask that people that rate this, please don’t review bomb it. You not only are doing a disservice to the company, but to all the people who want to enjoy what they have created. It really is a labor of love from them.",4,7
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Elden Ring is phenomenal. While maybe not being the most innovative life changing experience some critics would have you believe. Despite all the technical flaws I believe it stands above and From Software have delivered a master piece. While I do feel it may be too early to post my opinion, I’ve spent 40 hours in the game with no end in sight, I felt the need to post in support as review bombers run rampant. Is this game for everybody? No it’s not.Is this one of the best souls experiences of all time? Personally yes, I believe From Soft has only gotten better with each entry, sekiro being my favorite all around.In reality this is just dark souls 4 but as anyone who was looking forward to this can tell you, that’s exactly what we wanted.If you want a game that doesn’t hold your hand and doesn’t stop you every 5 minutes to remind you of your goals or where to go, and a game that has a satisfying loop of explore, battle, loot, level. This is the game for you. With an open world that so far is unfathomably large detailed and interesting and some of the most interesting enemy and boss encounters in the series. With a ton more freedom to how to build a character. This is easily an all time classic soulsborne experience. The last thing I’ll say is a lot of people complain about the lack of quest logs, mini map, and general map markers, but the game does actually do a very good job of guiding you and keeping you on track. I am the kind of person who gets fatigued by seeing all the incomplete quests and areas I still have to explore, and Elden Ring simply allows you to wander and get lost without asking you to stop and collect 1/500 something’s for a reward. I only have maybe 1/3 or less of the map uncovered with 40 hours in and I have yet to not be surprised around every corner.",4,7
"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Very artistic game with dark soul energy. Love the boss fight and a bit different than the traditional soul's bourne genre. The storyline is interesting. Love the gameplay.,4,7
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is my first Souls game, so I'm not in that hardcore camp.Elden Ring is basically Skyrim's freedom of wandering with an amazing combat system and no hand holding. If lack of a quest journal turns you off, that's okay. It doesn't for me, it makes me feel that everything I do is more immersed in the world.If bosses wrecking you for 2 hours before you squeeze out a win turns you off, that's alright too. I enjoy overcoming that high hurdle, making me feel a sense of pride and accomplishment I haven't had in a game in many years.This may not be for you, but it is for me. From my perspective, this game is a 10/10. I love overcoming obstacles and being treated like an adult. Then again, I played Myst when it came out and the idea of using a notebook doesn't make me furious.",4,7
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Full discloser, I'm a huge fan of the ""soulsborne - shadows die a bunch series"". I've got 100's of hours in the souls trilogy, platinum trophy in Sekiro and Bloodborne, and i'm about 3/4 through the Demons Souls remake. that being said, i hate game hype. i see hype trains and avoid them like the plague because I am typically disappointed in the end result. So, i avoided any hype for Elden Ring and went in to this game completely blind, just because i trust the developers track record. And my goodness. This game has taken a format that i love and somehow has polished it and tweaked it to become one of the most satisfying games i think i've ever played.

Open world games have become fairly cookie-cutter in the last decade or so and i was very suspicious about what direction this game would take. would it be dark souls with towers to climb and 1000 collectibles to check off a list? with fetch quests and objective markers? everything we know to be part of the AAA open-world space? nope, they spat in the face of the norm, even alienating some potential player in the process, to make something that actually feels fresh and new in a space that is mired in the old. Sure, it feels like dark souls, combat wise, but it's polished and rebalanced to feel like something familiar but new. and its take on the open world is something that i didn't even know i was looking for. No hand holding, no clear cut paths or clunky fetch quests, no repetitive checklist collectibles. just a beautiful, brutal, hand crafted world that you get dumped in to and have to forge your own path and adventure.

Truly one of the greatest games to come out in recent history, if not a contender for best game of all time.",4,7
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This Game is as close to perfection as video games can come. I've seen so many people get to the first or second main story boss and just give up. These people go on to leave a 5 or less review on this website. Please at least complete 80% of the game before crying and calling the game bad because you couldn't beat a boss. Don't get me wrong, this game will piss you off. Ruthless bosses and enemies being the main contributers to this factor. But they are all set up in a way that makes it fair, even to less experienced gamers. For example, The first main story boss, you can summon a mage named Rogier. This npc will shoot spells at the boss and draw aggro to provide an innate advantage to less experienced players. It is totally okay to absolutely hate this game if that is your opinion, but when you get frustrated and quit after 5-10 hours of playing, then proceed to write a negative review on the game, your opinion becomes invalid.",4,7
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I'm reading the negative reviews, and wondering if (besides performance issues, of which I have none) and asking myself ""did this people play the same game I did?"". The criticism they do is the opposite of what this game actually is. One review said that the world looked bleak and repetitive. Wow... it is the exact opposite. Maybe they played for just 20 minutes??

I played for 35 hours. I didn't even complete 1/3 of the game.

At every turn I am astonished of how incredible the world looks. Build diversity seems huge. Soloing bosses is actually hard. Boss mechanics are one of the most creative I've seen in any Souls game. Multiplayer is greatly improved compared to past souls games.

Basically, this is Dark Souls definitive edition and then some more, in a very well executed open world. Every open world area feels utterly distinct. Jeez, I have no idea how anyone can say ""every area looks bleak and repetitive"". It is striking how distinctive each area is. Maybe they were playing another game and didn't notice.

Also, area traversal is a puzzle in itself, since there are lots of huge vertical slopes. That prevents one from just rushing through a zone and favors exploration.

This game is mindbowingly amazing. I would give it an 11 if I could. I've never played anything even remotely close to this in terms of how good it is.

That doesn't mean everyone would love this game since some people are just not into souls games, might find it too hard or that it takes too much time, or just not into fantasy settings. But then no game is meant to please all the crowds, but rather one specific crowd very well.",13,23
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Eng/ItaThe souls evolution that we needed, in an open world gameplay whit lots of secret that gift the player whit new objects that evolve your possibilities . We have semplification mixed whit evolution too from dark souls like the ashes of war that let you add a unic move on your weapon and change the ability scaling of that weapon so the player has a big freedom to play as he like. The boss fight are amazing, even the secondary , the environment are huge and different, filled whit secrets that expand your gameplay, and the style of the world take inspiration from all the from software game but having a own soul that distinguish Elden ring from his predecessor . The main problem for me was the difficulty wich start pretty easy and than slap your face whit the first big boss fight of the game which is much harder  than anything you have met before in the game, but teaching you whit brute force how the new gameplay is and telling you to use everything you have to win. Graphics is that of an old gen game, not amazing but still good since the game is not an exclusive for one console and need to run on every platformMy true vote is 9/10 but I give 10/10 for the dumb people review bombing whitout even playing the game L’evoluzione al gameplay souls che serviva in salsa open world, con numerosi segreti che premiano donando oggetti che ampliano sempre di più le possibilità del giocatore, insieme a semplificazioni per variare il proprio gameplay tramite le numerose ceneri di guerra che oltre ad aggiungere una mossa diversa per ognuna cambiano lo scaling o il tipo di danno per l’arma. Le Boss fight sono magnifiche , comprese quelle secondarie e ambientazioni varie che passano dall’inquietante all’onirico, unendo elementi presenti in dark soul, bloodborne e sekiro ma aggiungendo una propria anima all’interno. La pecca principale è la curva di difficoltà che è fin troppo ripida  passando da relativamente semplice nei primi momenti fino all’incontro con il primo boss importante che invece è una terapia d’urto al nuovo stile di gameplay che spinge il giocatore ad usare tutto quello che ha a propria disposizione e che l’open world ti dona. La grafica è quella di un videogioco old gen ma considerando la necessità di girare su qualsiasi piattaforma è comunque un buon risultatoLascio 10/10 solo per le recensioni dei frustrati che non lo hanno nemmeno giocato ma il mio voto sarebbe 9/10",13,23

Jesus Christ. Obviously lots of people were baited into buying this game, because ""apparently now everyone can play it"", who cares that 80% can't even beat first boss, am i right? Just cause it sold over million copies means absolutely nothing. 80% will never beat the first boss, 90% will never complete the whole game or even half of it. This is not what mainstream means. GTA 5 is mainstream, because people keep playing. 80% who bought Elden Ring will figure out that it's not for them and quit. And then of course in same video they need to bash Ubisoft games as much as possible, they just can't help themselves lmao. Arguments like ""all Ubisoft games are same"" are especially hilarious now when Elden Ring is literally copy pasting other souls games, in open world setting.

By the way let's get this idiotic thing out of the way, no, all Ubisoft games are not the same, as much as you want it to be true, it's simply not true. Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs and Ghost Recon Wildlands are not same games as much as Ubisoft hater would like them to be. Simply not true. They might share some similar elements, but overall they are all completely their own thing.

But in other hand, Elden Ring is literally re-using animations from 2016 video game. I have nothing against Youtubers giving their opinion about video games and whatever else. It's great. Just kind of sucks that lots of them have absolute trash taste in gaming, but it is what it is i guess. By the way that trash taste would be also complete fine, if they wouldn't be so butthurt over Ubisoft, that they need to sht on that company every moment possible.

Once I was able to finally play it the performance was horribly on a 3090 / 5900x. Ok no sweat I thought it was a port.Purchased it on the PS5 and it runs smoothly other than these few issues.

It adds nothing new to gaming that hasn’t been done elsewhere and typically done (much) better. Movement and combat certainly have improved compared to previous iterations of this game. The overall accessibility is still bad, be it by design or incompetence. For example, the inventory is so clunky and dated. Key information on items stats is hidden, for a “core” game this should be easily accessible. Most of the game’s difficulty comes from obfuscation of the game’s mechanics, so you have to resort to online guides &amp; walkthroughs. The current v2 of this game is riddled with bugs making it very easy ridiculously easy. Most encounters can be completely bypassed and “legendary” loot (broken, overpowered) can just be grabbed without effort. For a game who’s USP is to “be hard” this makes it a complete joke.

Beautiful level-design specially inside castles. But we already know what Miyazaki can do.

"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Overhyped and overrated game.  Not terrible, but not good either.  Feels like the From Software put their B team (Dark Souls 2) on this project.

To provide context, I think it important to start by saying I've been a huge fan of the SoulsBorne series since the day Demons Souls was released.  I've loved the twisted worlds they've created, the way they reward a combination of creativity, observation and reaction.

So here are the FromSoft Games I've finished, and my rough grade:
- Bloodborne (A+)
- Dark Souls (A)
- Demon's Souls (A-)
- Sekiro (A-)
- Dark Souls 3 (B+)
- Dark Souls 2 (B-)

With that out of the way, let's talk Elden Ring.  From early gameplay video I can tell you I was not excited.  The new world and GRRM writing seemed interesting, but I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop:  what was this game adding to the formula that made it worth developing?

That moment never came, but that not stop the world from reaching maximum hype level about it.  A minority raised concerns and complaints with these early videos - about the animations looking reused from DS3, the graphics looking subpar, etc - these people were shouted down.  I've also noticed some in the community railing against the game, because their favorite cult series suddenly went mainstream and Twitch trash are turning it into the flavor of the month.  That is not me.

I will admit I have my biases, and count myself in the group that complained about the reused animations and last gen graphics - however neither of those were dealbreakers for me.

Pros:
- Bite-sized chalice dungeons that reward exploration.
- Huge set of weapons and spells.
- The mount is cute and controls well.

Cons:
- Framerate sucks on PS5 w/ performance mode
- XP feels super grindy.
- Mounted combat is not fun.
- So many reused bosses.  You'll see the exact same boss multiple times during the game, and they didn't even bother making it look different.  (Think the Smelter Demon x4)
- Bosses push further down the trend that DS3 set, being more about twitch reaction and DPS checks, rather than rewarding smart play.
- Bosses and many enemies seem to have endless combos.  This makes ranged combat like archery and magic relatively unbalanced.  You're almost guaranteed to trade hits with a boss to get any damage in, bucking the 'call-and-response'/observe-punish gameplay that made the series great.
- AI feels really cheap.  There seems to be 3 levels of AI awareness:  Oblivious, aggroed, road raged.  Enemies often stand around doing nothing.  A lot of enemies have cheap AOE abilities that come out quicker than is possible to react and move out of damage range.  These usually are ground stomps, earthquakes caused by weapon slams, etc.  The area affected is not well indicated, and feel really cheap.  The only way to avoid them is to get lucky with I-frames on your roll.
- The world feels really boring.  Much of it is empty.  Geometry and decorations seem randomly strewn about.  Outdoor dungeons make no sense, like in a Dark Souls 2 way.  Things will link together in ways that don't make sense.  There is even a castle with a big gate and a draw bridge, and when you get inside... you go up an elevator... like wtf...
- Most of the NPCs are really generic and boring.  Their dialogue writing and voice acting is poor, and they carry on with exposition about meaningless things.
- The opening cinematic is a huge step back from other Soulsborne games.
- The non-weapon item designs are dumb, and don't seem to fit any sort of cohesive theme like the other games.
- UI screens, especially the inventory screens are really poorly designed.  They lack the character of previous games.  They give you way too much information and not enough at the same time, and navigating them is a real chore of contextual toggle buttons.  The font and backgrounds are very generic and lack that FromSoft character.
- The item descriptions are now only a single byline sentence, where before they provided so much lore and character to the world, now I don't feel any reason to read them.
- The color grading is ugly.
- Summoning spells are passive and lame, and really don't fit with the gameplay.
- So many encounter and enemy designs have been reused.  It honestly feels like a FromSoft greatest hits compilation than any sort of original design.  If you're a fan of the series, you'll find yourself saying 'oh hey, that's X from Y game. Only it has been reskinned.'
- Some boss fights are a huge chore.  Running around the enemy in circles while locked on (a'la Sekiro), getting a single hit in for 1% damage, waiting 30 secs, getting another hit.  It's a real slog - even with good upgraded weapons and gear.
- The crafting system sucks.  Costs way too many souls for key ingredients from shopkeepers.  Adds nothing of value, and requires you to pick up respawning ingredients on the map - one of my least favorite mechanics in modern games (Elder Scrolls).",5,9
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Everything I was hoping for and more. Fromsoft just doesn’t miss, does it.

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Best open world game in recent years, you will get lost in the big big world and that's a good thing. Nowadays too many game hand-held you and tell you to go here and there, character's continuously talking to themselves what they should do, or like a giant pop-up tutorial that stops the gameplay completely to tell you how to attack, I'm glad this game is not any of those.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"I had pretty hight hopes for the game but I was pretty disappointed. Especially after playing demons souls which was a fantastic game.My biggest problem with the game is how awful it looks, at first I thought it was because I was playing in performance mode so I switched to quality mode, and it still looked awful . Like a PS3 game. So I thought oh it's because it's just not optimized for PS5 so I got it on PC too and no. It did not look any better and ran even worse. My second problem with the game is how bland the open world is. Yes tons of bosses in caves that are basically just normal enemies with larger health pools.the actual world itself was so empty.. it was a good idea but hopefully they execute the idea better in the future",11,20
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"This ladies and gentlemen is how you make something into one of the most overrated products of all time. The critic score is absolute **** After 20+ hours and tons of Souls experience on my belt, I can say that Elden Ring is one of the most unfun gaming experiences I've had in a long time. The game makes me think of the equally overrated Breath of the Wild. The world is massive, but not interesting. There are NPC's, but all of them are bland. There's actually very little to do other than gather materials for useless garbage or things you can't even make yet. After that, you just have fighting and while I love the combat and the new skills system, this all falls apart due to the terrible design. In the later areas, enemies are often in so high number, so powerful and worth so little that there is zero point in fighting them. They are no longer fun obstacles to fight through, they are now insanely unbalanced chores that you are better off just running around to continue your boring exploration. Then you'll likely encounter one of the many bosses, tons of which seem to be optional but most are terrible. This game's bosses are either 1. So incredibly easy that you can kill them in your sleep or 2. So infuriatingly unfun and cheap that you'll want to hang yourself. There is no inbetween. Tons of bosses here feel so over designed that they are a total chore to go against. Many have long strings of combos that you spend most of your time dodging forever to only get maybe one tiny hit in. Of course, no matter how buff you are, the bosses are basically all two hit kills towards you. Make two mistakes and boom, dead, all that time wasted. It makes you feel like you are never getting stronger and the game always pummels you, making the RPG elements worthless. From Software has gone so far overboard with the difficulty that it basically now requires perfection for long periods of time or die.  Eventually I don't give a **** anymore. All of that hype is worthless. We've gone from tightly crafted worlds with bosses that feel natural to it and the gameplay and progression, to a mind numbing slog of running and smashing your head to a wall. Don't bother.",12,22

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Sadly, the game is being review bombed by smoothbrains who’ve been coddled too much by Ubisoft titles. They complain of empty worlds when my map is filled with POIs and dungeons, with valuable weapons and armour scattered in nooks rewarding exploration. They complain about performance whilst playing on 7 year old hardware. They complain about no unique ways to travel whilst I find portals connection opposite ends of the map and an elk that can double jump. They complain about copy and pasted environments and enemies yet every major area/biome are extremely diverse and exciting. I’ve around 30 hours played and it’s painfully obvious who’ve played &gt;2 hours, got stuck on a miniboss, didn’t explore anything, and left an emotional 0 before they went to go grab a glass of soy milk. I found an abandoned ruin inside of a mist laden forest. I entered an elevator inside of it. Next thing I know I’m in a massive underground city with immeasurable scale, with geodes on the far ceiling acting as ambient light, reminiscent of the night sky with no light pollution. The sense of wonder and scale in this game is grand, with no areas being similar to the previous in any way. It’s a marvel of gaming as a whole. It’s the magnum opus of a developer who’s given us GOTY after GOTY. If you’re a game enthusiast with half a brain, this may top your list.

This IS a souls game, souls combat, souls spells, souls layouts and souls brutality ( Unless you choose astrologer or build into cheesorceries ). Having said that they have greatly expanded on what you would call the souls game foundation. The open world is huge, very very dense and unique as hell. The bosses are amazing. It's just a huge open world souls game adventure.

From the little time I have spent attempting to play a Souls game in the past, Elden Ring feels pretty much the same. The odd, washed out and dated looking graphics, the little messages players leave behind, the difficulty of the enemies; it is all there. And I will try some more, just as I did with Dark Souls, 1, 2, 3 and Bloodborne, but I am fairly confident I absolutely hate it.  Elden Ring mechanics and visuals are like an early PS4 game.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"For anyone who has played a Souls game before and enjoyed it, this is an absolutely massive open world full of adventure, intricate level design, wild boss fights, trippy landscapes, and trademark bizarro storytelling. Absolutely mind-blowing.For first-timers: Yes, these games have a learning curve, and admittedly it may not seem so fun the first several hours while you're learning how to fight. Focus on discovery, pick easier fights, and ease your way in. These games are like learning to drive a manual transmission - it's a pain at first, but once you pass that threshold of learning it becomes so satisfying and fun it's hard to imagine going back to automatic (or to a typical game with button mashing combat and cheesy Hollywood narrative).Many of the negative reviews seem to obsess over performance issues but I have played 40 hours and never experienced anything affecting my playthrough. Many others seem to be posting negative user reviews without having played much of the game, possibly as a reaction to all the positive critic reviews.

+ Great gameplay
+ An open world that invites to exploration, whenever you go you will find something worth the trouble. + The art direction is outstanding.
+ The change made to welcome new players are well implemented and makes sense.

- Poor performance.
- Graphics feel a little outdated but the art direction compensates this downside, however, it could be better.
- Technical issues in general (hopefully will be fixed).

This is a huge step forward in the souls series, exploring the world is addictive and unless you are having game breaking issues, you will enjoy this very much.",8,15
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,2,"I played this game and i could stand it only for 3 hours, just another extremely over hyped and overrated game by from software first of all the gameplay is a huge step backward from sekiro (even though i didn't like that game either) the combat is slow, clunky and tedious and most importantly unacceptably difficult without any option to customize the difficulty that's an industry standard that from software intentionally doesn't follow. other than difficulty which is no problem for those who have hours of time to die and retry (I don't, i'm a busy person aren't most of us?) the whole gameplay and the world of the game feels very old like early 7th generation games old. the world and the map is pretty much empty and it's funny that the critics are praising elden ring for being open world as if they have never seen an open world game in their life!
while the game has a relatively good artistic design and as all from software games the bosses and enemies have amazing design but the technical graphics of the game is like ps3 games and not acceptable for a 9th generation game.
as always the story of the game is just there... not interesting at all it doesn't motivate you to keep playing you are left in a huge map full of empty..
overall it's a big shame and saddening that this game has a meta score close to masterpieces like RDR 2, GTA 4 &amp; 5, god of war, etc how the hell didn't even one critic didn't give this game a score lower than 90 I tried too hard but it's impossible to enjoy this game.",8,15

The way Miyazaki reinvented the Dark Souls formula and implemented it on a massive and dense open world is perfect. The gameplay despite being more or less the same feels so fresh compared to other souls games due to the sheer variety of weapons that can be used. The mount combat is also very fun and I often find myself clearing out whole encampments while on a mount. The bosses feel challenging and high in quality.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"I have found the frame rate and graphics perfectly acceptable in this game.  The desire to explore this beautifully rendered open world is quite strong.  However, it stops there.  I know a lot of players truly love the mechanics of figuring out how to defeat a tough boss, and this game will surely hit the mark for them.  For me, and those that really enjoy exploring an open world with some tension lingering to make the exploration process more alluring.  This game crushes that joy of exploration.  Explore a little, encounter a mob that takes a long, repetitive effort to defeat, explore a little more, then spend a long tine trying to defeat the next mob.  It saps all the fun and joy out of exploration.  I have purchased From Software games in the past, and never completed any due to the repetitive, time sucking requirements necessary to make any progress in the game.  It is a shame.  The games are beautiful and appealing, but only assessable to a few.  Someday they will realize they could dramatically boost sales by adding a normal and hardcore mode to their games, and the ability to concoct health potions from ingredients gathered along the way.",9,17
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,4,"Ok so ive been playing the game since its release so had a good few weeks of gameplay to give an honest review. What disappoints me most with elden ring is the lack of story, you just seem to be wondering around the open world with no clear goal or purpose of what you are supposed to be doing. I get that the developers probably wanted to create a sense of adventure and exploration but for me it just seemed like you are wondering around aimlessly trying to get strong enough to beat the next impossible monster you come across.Talking about monsters and boss fights, firstly id like to say i felt like the combat dynamics are very laboured compared to other rpg games ive played. Considering this game has been built up to be the next big thing i was very disappointed. Fighting any major battle is this game is a challenge to say the least, be prepared to die a hell of a lot. Due to the lack of structure in the game you can come across impossible fights early on,  which all add to the frustration when playing. I found myself going online and looking at walkthrough guides just to get an idea of what direction to take with the game.Graphics arnt the best and not the most polished ive seen in an open world game, ok the world is well created however its all very similar with not much variety.Overall i have to say im disappointed, lack of direction, poor combat system and none existent story makes this a game that doesnt please but gets you very very frustrated.",9,17
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"IGN Japan's Review was a complete inversion of every truth about the game. It is tedious and filled with chores. Many enemies are merely a part of the scenery. The game encourages dull exploration and then changes it up on a dime with a randomly-placed boss. The game is awful, overrated, is possibly worse than even Dark Souls 2, the black sheep of the Souls family, and that is saying a lot from me, because I think Dark Souls 2 is one of the worst games ever made. A horrifying tour-de-force in how to remain frustrated for 10 hours of your day trying to complete the chore list and 50+ annoying boss encounters. Just as a redditor admitted hitting his wife out of frustration against Margit, the first main boss. The game is awful, terrible, and I cannot stress it enough. Also, there is no story. There's not even a lore. Not even if you look for it.

Every single positive reviewer was paid off. This game should never have been made, and George R.R. Martin contributed nothing worthy of note.

EDIT: I am making a further edit to my initial impressions. When you take the game in small bits, take your time to explore everything and build up your inventory, and also make sure not to take on Margit, the first primary boss too early, you might find enjoyment. The latter half of the game is very difficult, and once you get to Godskin Duo, you had better be very overleveled. Overall, the beginning of the game is enjoyable, but the second half is balls-to-the-wall hard due to game tuning issues.

Edit2: The game further drops off in quality after Limgrave and Weeping Peninsula. Very much DS2 vibes. Overall not good.",9,17

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"While the game is fun I can only give it a 5 out of 10 strictly because its abusive toward the consumer as far as how straight punishing combat is.

What I mean is bosses have very small hit boxes an can strike through walls an objects while your weapons bounce off of walls an objects an cannot hit the enemy through objects that cause collision like they can.

Then bosses tend to move very fast an deal massive damage almost once shotting you every time, if your a meele build the game will punish you even worse but not as bad for casters.

A game should be enjoyable you shouldn't be dying 30 times in a row just to get by an enemy, an people can say get good but that isn't even half the problem, most of the time you can't find the things needed to upgrade your weapons an the only armour altering down grades it absolutely nothing yet to improve it.

On top of this their is times the enemy's weapon clearly did not strike me but I still take damage from them, then they also have you fighting multiple fast moving bosses at one time.

Nothing about encounters is really fun with over 100 hours in I find myself constantly getting more an frustrated with the overall decision making as far as combat goes because it is no longer fun but more makes me want to send foul nasty messages to the devs because they clearly don't know the correct mix between fun an challenging what this game is, is strictly crap all the good an wonderful things about it arw straight ruined by super challenging enemy's an if you die well you lose all your experience making leveling harder because its also your money too.

Then lets get into the crap frame rate that is constantly dipping close an close to 30FPS rather than 60.

Then you also have idiot players leaving messages on things you need to interact with making offline play almost a necessity because it becomes annoying while playing.

No point really in greater runes either because you have to find a rune arc to activate them but they seem to be in very limited supply or cost over 4000 exp a pop.

While I started off loving the game now that I am on the mountain of giants area I am ready to quit over just not being able to kill anything because enemy's disappear an then are instantly behind you then throw combo after combo relentless leaving you no opening whatsoever an if you do strike they are never stund like you are but can attack through all your moves an kill you instantly.

I really hated this game at first but I wanted to keep playing it to see if it gets better and it really did. It’s a shame it took so long. Part of the fun for me is playing with my brother. When we’re not playing together in the game we’re discussing what we’ve found and share it with each other. For anyone that hasn’t played any dark souls games, watch some guides of elden ring and give it a good try. I’m glad I did after hating it the first couple hours.",11,21
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This game is absolutely amazing. I'm concerned with all the strange people reviewing with 3 and less on a game that came out 2 days ago that reviews only the framerates and graphics. Absolutely 0 concerns for gameplay and the actual thrill of this game. It is awesome, great world, tight combat, genius coop, and there's always something to find around the corner. A true masterpiece. Don't listen to the butthurts or you will miss on an incredible game that will surely mark a generation.",11,21
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is not a game... THIS IS THE GAME for all the true lovers of From Software world.
Great first step in an open world concept, the only disappointment I could have is making it a lot easier than their respective titles, but that was to be expected if they wanted to try to hook new categories of players.
Exploration allows you to find objects and upgrade so that you get super powered when you decide to devote yourself to the main story.
Anyway really TY for this game",11,21

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"I was fooled by all the good reviews! What's wrong with the game testers, please? I knew what I was getting into when I started Elden Ring: it's a Dark Souls 4 in an open world. I had a few hours of fun with Dark Souls 3, so I wanted to give the game a chance. So I got infected by the countless good reviews and bought the game yesterday for 60 euros. But then what do I have to experience on my PS5. Underground graphics - PS3 niveau -  (even Dark Souls 3 was better by lengths!!!) many jerks and frame pacing problems. The fight is an absolute horror with it. The controls are so imprecise, and the HitBoxes are a disgrace to this series. No PS5 controller specific features implemented! I hope I can find someone to buy this game from me who has more fun with it. I am out, FromSoftware. In the future, only at budget price, or when there are demo versions (see Cyberpunk 2077, Project Red finally got it after 1.5 years). The gaming industry is so broken! What's wrong with the test magazines. A game in this technical state can't be a 10/10. Many other games have been devalued and punished because of this - but not so here. Dear game testers, please be objective again!!!",12,24
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"Played DS 1-3, BB, Demon‘s Souls and Sekiro (All Platinum) and was hyped for Elden Ring. Right now after 10 h of playing I‘m very disappointed. I‘m trying as hard as I can to like the game but there are just too many cons/ not enough pros yet.

- performance is really bad on PS 5 even in performance mode (40-50 fps) + multiple crashes. That is not acceptable on PS 5 in 2022. Actually unplayable for me

- missing Story/ Character development (George RR Martin? Where?!)

-graphics in general are outdated (not the artstyle, i love it)

- Open World feels empty (maybe because the lack of some story?) Compared to other high quality openworld games I feel like there isn‘t much to explore. The few dungeons are very short, boring and repetitive. At least most other areas are restricted simply by being to hard -&gt; not my definition of an open world (For reference I‘ve beaten M***it at Lvl. 16 with no help)

All these points resulting in cluelessness what to do next. Nothing is really interesting for me. Seems like an unfinished and unpolished game. Therefore 0 points.",12,24

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"FromSoftware have outdone themselves. The open world gameplay is fantastic and builds upon a design philosophy that rewards curiosity, creativity and the player's determination to overcome obstacles. The world is filled with things to discover and since there are no markers on the map that instantly spoil any feeling of adventure, the lands between feel even more big and mysterious than they actually are.

The difficulty forces the player to use every item and skill that is available to them and utilize them in creative ways. It might be frustrating, especially for new players who may not see the possibility to strengthen their characters before returning to an enemy that seemed too hard previously. There's always a organic difficulty setting inside of the game's mechanics, that lets players choose how hard an encounter should be.

I don't want to make this too long and most of the things have already been said. What makes this game special are the small and epic moments that truly feel like the player's on an adventure through a unique and mysterious world that is designed with the craftsmanship of true masters of their work.",8,16

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Only current downside to this game that I can possibly come up with is the state of its performance on release. I play it on PC, but I have heard it is having significant issues on the PS5. This is obviously something that will be fixed with time.

On the game itself: The graphics are absolutely stupendous, if you think they are bad, I don't know what to tell you. Go play an EA game where the whole budget went to graphics and none on gamplay. This game is beautiful. The textures are high-res, the weather affects the bushes, trees, and grass. The effects like a big impact, an explosion, or a magic spell are very well done.

The gameplay: It is the Souls games combat refined and perfected. The diversity of possible stat combinations, weapons, and playstyles is through the roof. Where in previous games you had the option of pure STR, pure DEX, DEX/INT, STR/FTH, or INT/FTH, now the game much more freely lets you mix and make your own unique build. You just have to go and find the pieces.

If you've played Dark Souls 1, you might know that it was lauded for it's openness. If you had played it before, you could make a beeline straight to a certain item, area, or weapon and tackle parts of the game in any order you want (to a degree) well, ER has brought that back in full force. Speedruns for this game may take decades to evolve. You can go ANYWHERE, even if a boss blocks your path, if you have the skill to brute-force it, you can go claim whatever weapon or item you need to make your special run possible.

And the map is colossal. It definitely didn't take the shape I was expecting, but even hearing how big it was, I was still astonished. I've seen some criticisms that the world is too big, and empty. This couldn't be further from the truth. The world is full and alive. There is loot or an enemy, or an NPC waiting to sell you a rare item around every corner. Unassuming cliffside? There's a little tunnel that goes into a sprawling mine. A random shack on the shore? There's a merchant in there, and he has just the weapon you were looking for. Heading to the lonely corner of the map where there's sure to be nothing? Nope. Huge optional dungeon full of loot, challenges, and puzzles.

Also, despite the size of the world, even if you've seen a certain area so many times you're sick of it, you have a FAST horse, and you can fast-travel any time you aren't in combat.

Not only is the world big, but the SCALE of the things within it are outrageous. Elden ring presents itself as having an Epic atmosphere and it delivers on it. It takes itself seriously. There are some incredibly majestic enemies, almost like Shadow of the Colossus.

Don't listen to the contrarians. This game is actually BETTER than the hype. If you are looking for a game that is both challenging and freeing at the same time, it's for you. Some of the bosses aren't for the faint-hearted. Embrace death. It's part of the gameplay loop.

But maybe wait and listen for word on performance optimizations, just in case. The game is certainly playable at high settings, and I have just under the recommended PC specs. It's just that some enemies, animations, locations, etc. Cause some stuttering. Hopefully it is fixed soon. If it does get completely fixed, this is one of the greatest games EVER made.",8,16
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Pinnacle of the franchise hands down. I expected a game half that size. World and story are amazing, combat even better than DS3 and Difficulty spicy as always. The PC port is a **** but even then the game is incredibly enjoyable.",8,16
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Honestly, from the ratings they gave this game, I was excited. But I don't know how a game can have such a high rating, but not impress that much.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring has a lot of mechanics carried over from the previous Soulsborne games, layered with a ton of new and welcomed mechanics, combined with an enormous yet dense handcrafted open world. There is a lot to love, and a lot that will be a hit or miss for many people, even for the Soulsborne fans. I personally am loving the whole package, especially how the game encourages curious explorations, and rewards them with surprising unique encounters and rewards. Miyazaki, in his typical way, engages in an ambiguous non-verbal dialogue with the players. As usual, a lot is communicated through environmental storytelling, scattered scripts, and gameplay. However, this time around I am finding it easier to read into. Big changes in approach will be needed for the people coming in with a muscle memory. And there is an intimidating amount of learning required for new players - so I can only recommend it to those who are motivated to put in the effort.",7,14

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I love this game so far. Last year to challenge myself, I decided to play Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro back to back, having not played any of them before, as a challenge.
At first it seemed impossibly difficult, and I thought I had made a terrible mistake, but eventually something clicked in my head and I understood. Thinking of the games as being punishingly difficult is a miscategorization of what they are doing. They are, more than anything, trying to get you to play them on their own terms, rather than your own. In. a way, it felt like learning to play Tony Hawk Pro Skater. It wanted something very specific from me, that wasn't exactly in my wheelhouse, but once I started to pay attention to what it was asking, the games opened up to me.
Elden Ring feels like the culmination of every experiment, every idea that the studio has tried from Demon's Souls onward. The levels are some of the most polished, most fully realized they have ever produced. The bosses are cool and unique, the overworld feels full of possibility and excitement.
I also think it's the most fair and giving game that they've produced of this kind. If you feel stuck on something, there are hundreds of other areas to explore, and lower level enemies to fight and gain experience and hone your skills on, rather than being stuck in 1-2 places, or going through the paces of farming for xp or resources in an old spot.
If you don't like it, that's fine, it doesn't have to be for you, but personally I love it, and if you're trying the game and feel like you might have made a mistake, I would ask, before you give it up and write it off, just take some time to go  explore. See what you find. Try doing something different, experiment with a different build. There's a lot of opportunity in this game, if you go looking for it.",7,14

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is an experience like no other. It's absolutely stunning. It's a game that respects it's audience and treats them like adults, it challenges them at every turn and gives them a world to actually discover and lose themselves in. It's absolutely mind-blowing that this game exists - I never thought I'd see a video game like this in my life.

Yes, the game is challenging - but that's precisely the point. I don't want to play a game that a seven year old child can pick up and play, because in the end that's who that game is tailored towards. I want to be respected. I want to be tested. I want the thrill of discovery and triumph. This game has that in spades.

The graphics aren't superb, but honestly, I like it like that. The way they are it helps to create the sense of unreality, like a living dream that can be stepped into at any time. The graphics aren't what's important - it's the design. It's a meticulous and well-wrought world and some, unfortunately, are unable to look up from the ground to see that.

If you have some patience and give this game the time it deserves you will be well rewarded with one of the greatest gaming experiences of your life. So, don't give up, because that's when you have really lost.",7,14

There should at least be a difficulty setting for those folks who just want to explore and see the world without literally dying every other encounter.  Not everyone has hours a day and patience to try boss fights 30+ times until you figure things out.

This game isn't accessible to normal gamers who just want to sit back and have some entertaining evenings on the couch to forget the stress of the day.  I really don't get why there isn't a difficulty setting.",6,12

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Best game I've played in a few years. Been playing for 8h straight this game is just so fun i could play it all day.The Open-world feels alive and the combat system is awesome.,6,12
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Most polished and well put together AAA title in years. Fromsoft always hits the mark and this is no exception.,6,12
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Absolutely amazing, Fromsoft has mastered their unique SoulsLike genre with this game. It truly feels like their magnum opus.Combat has been refined from previous titles with extra options to tackle bosses and other opponents. Seriously I can't believe I've been playing Dark Souls without jump attacks or guard counters, they feel great to use.Absolutely jawdropping boss fights and stunning art direction in The Lands Between. I constantly have to take a moment to stop what I'm doing and just take in what I'm seeing.A refined version of Dark Souls wrapped in a huge open world with lots of secrets and hours upon hours of exploration.",6,12
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Absolutely amazing do not listen to these review bombers. This game is incredible, the performance issues have been massively overexaggerated by what I can only assume are people who are more upset that the game does not look and or feel like your cookie cutter ubisoft open world where everything is spelled out so that a 5 year old could follow along.There are frame drops every now and then I'll admit, but you will not notice half the time cause there so minor, plus you'll be to busy exploring/fighting in a world so beautiful and cared for you won't mind. Also others seem to be saying that this game is empty, devoid, and samey. This could not be further from the truth, it's painfully obvious that many of these players made it 2 hours in a gave up. As for me I have play around 30 hours and have discovered probably 30% of the map, crawled countless dungeons, fought epic bosses, listened to exceptional music, and had the most fun I've ever had whilst gaming. To see this getting trashed is a travesty to game design. This is a technical marvel, a game of our generation, to sit there and get butt hurt cause the graphics aren't Horizon Forbidden West is an insult. Ask yourself is the game fun, and if the answer is yes who gives a flip( btw the game is beautiful). I am also hearing these same players complain about there being no story with is absolutely absurd, because it literally gives you lore and story with every character and boss and environment you meet. Do not be swayed by these crybabies who need there hands held while they take a dump. BUY THIS GAME if it's the only game you ever get, if your not a mental reject you will understand why this is one of the greatest games of our generation.  #thanksforcomingtomytedtalk",6,12

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Absolute masterpiece.  I’ve played each and every Fromsoftware game since Demon’s Souls ever since I broke through the difficultly barrier and it all finally clicked with Bloodborne.  It turned into a massive addiction.  I have since played all of them over and over again.  I have essentially exclusively played Fromsoftware games since 2015.  I’ll continue to do the same.  This game is incredible.  It is the pinnacle of souls.  This makes the prior six games look like trials.  They took every great piece of every game they made it put it into one.  It doesn’t just feel like Dark Souls III or Sekiro.  It feels like Elden Ring.Congratulations Fromsoftware.  You have created an absolute masterpiece that continues to subvert my expectations with each passing day I have with this game.  I never want it to end.Fromsoftware fan or not, give this a try.  It might not be for you but if it is; it is truly something special.  I will be playing this for years.  Don’t mind the negative reviews from people who don’t have the patience for the difficulty and/or have the unrealistic expectation for a massive triple A game to run flawlessly on day one.  That just doesn’t happen.  Frankly, it runs beautifully for the scope and scale we are dealing with.  It will obviously be patched up in the future.  Whatever technical issues I may have noticed didn’t once take away from the grand experience I was having.",5,10
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I've been playing for 70 hours, but I haven't finished yet, but I can already say that this is the best game I've ever played!",5,10
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,Dark Souls was just the beginning. Mind blowing world building and exploration. Negative: It happens that I were overpowered or underpowered. The game process route is very unclear (could be also a positive point).,5,10

You can just find anything anywhere and the world is full of things waiting to be explored. The boss fights and ost's are also amazing. Thank you from software for making such a masterpiece.,5,10
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"I mean what could go wrong right. The formula FromSoft has made is a iron clad one. This game is mesmerizing, fun and also overwhelming all at the same time. You feel the DNA of all FromSoft games mostly Dark Souls and a little hint of Bloodborne and Sekiro. It's an amazing experience, that I haven't even beat yet. The point deduction is mainly because pop in and framerate issues are noticeable and can sometimes take you out of the game. I know its early but this is sometimes bad enough to where you think the game is faulty. But nonetheless Miyazaki and team deliver on this MASSIVE experience that is worth applauding. Just be aware that software issues may bug you a bit. Pun not intended.",5,10
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"It’s amazing, think of it like if you mixed Dark Souls with an open world game like Witcher 3. There’s crafting, lots of exploring and since it’s open world getting stuck in an area isn’t such a pain since you can go to other places and get some runes to better upgrade your character. Summoning spirits is fun and it helps newer players. Also, the bosses are still “hard” but fair and enjoyable, horseback fighting is amazing too! To top it all of every build has a use for FP, magicians use spells and swordsmen use ashes of war. Overall 10/10 imo",5,10
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I see on the first few days of launch that the user reviews are pretty low. I know that the game has has a rough launch on PC. But aside from that, i predicted this:

There was a huge hype train for this game. A big tornado of hype created by the Souls community, Youtubers looking for views and gaming media talking about this game like it was the 2nd coming of Jesus himself. This Hype tornado sucked in a bunch of players who never played a souls game in their lives and because of that, many of these people were expecting a Next Gen experience with Graphics and gameplay akin to what God Of War 2 will look like.

That's what happens when the hype train gets carried away. It happened with CyberPunk and it happened with Elden Ring. But the major difference is, Cyberpunk was the developers fault, and Elden Ring was the fault of the people who didnt do more research on what kind of game they were really getting into

I have a handful of friends who I've tried convincing to play a Dark Souls game for the last 10 years and they wouldn't. And now all of a sudden they all wanna play Elden Ring.

Well, sorry to the folks who were thinking they were about to get a naughty dog mixed with Elder Scrolls by Bethesda experience. You get exactly what we fans over the last 10 years have been asking for. A LARGER more fulfilled vision of the Dark Souls Universe and it is absolutely stunning and beautiful.

If you haven't played a FromSoftware Souls-Like game before, ask yourself this:

""Am i ready to play a game that doesn't hold my hand, challenges me and will give me no choice but to google stuff a bunch through my playthrough? Am i ready for a type of game I've never played before, one that rewards patience and persistence but always gives me a way to solve problems presented?""

This is a nerds game. And if you wanna be a gaming nerd like the rest of us, you're more than welcome to join us. If you're new and dont know where to start, check out VaatiVidya on Youtube. He's everyones go-to for Youtubers who cover FromSoftware content.

For the rest of you though, God of War 2 and Starfield come out later this year, just hold on until then.

Elden Ring is a perfect accumulation of all of FromSoftwares 6 previous Souls and Souls-Like games.
They took the formula and perfected it. I'm 20 hours in and i feel like i just started getting into the thick of it. This is a must play for anyone up to the challenge/know what there getting into. Im playing on PS5, and its been running great",5,10
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"DO NOT pay attention to the idiots review bombing this masterpiece, hundreds of people are giving this game 0/10 for some minor stuttering issues and most of them probably haven't actually played the game, it's sad to see.If you enjoy the soulsborne genre elden ring is a must play, simple as, and even if you haven't been able to get into it before this is a good starting point, in short buy this game, it's incredible",5,10

It has a story, it's just not told to you immediately, you have to actually play2.Empty.   This game is full of enemy parties and minibosses, I'm not sure what bullsh!t that is.3. Graphics are awful.   Fromsoftware never focuses on graphics, it focuses on gameplay and story. It is still the best looking game out there.4. Slow game play   No, you just have a slow brain. The gameplay is different form the other games and can be felt easily if you've played the other game.That all I have to say.

Thats fine, From Softs game are not meant to appeal to everyone. If you dont like gamings version of fine dining, stick to Ubisoft and good riddance. Make no mistake, this is a fantastic game. I find that people are complaining and scoring 0 out of 2 reasons: Either they nag about the framerate (A common player will rarely or ever notice the dips, and will for sure be fixed in an upcoming patch) or they simply dont understand they game.

Speaking of dungeons, they are so good,and the bigger ones the legacy dungeons are worth exprience. The grapich engine is the same, is not that impressive, but... as always, to all fromsoftware games, the art and design rules and makes the game stunning and beautiful. Im not gonna lie here  the game have some framerste drop, but in ps5 it doesn't affects bad your gameplay.

"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,Broken game. Somehow the game de-synced my files from the cloud and overwrote them with a file that was 41 hours prior to my most recent save and I basically had to start completely over.

Most people are not interested fighting every boss 20 times to learn their move set, Whole purpose of this game is just fight one boss after another and learn their move set, that's the whole thing.

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,"Never played a souls game. Watched lots of people screaming in frustration whilst they played them and thought that's not for me. Saw the promise that Elden Ring would be a more approachable game, designed for regular gamers to get into.
Turned out that was a big fat lie. It's no more approachable than any From software experience. The world is, ironically, pretty souless and a drab sepia colour. Every enemy is overpowered, the hit boxes, lag, and aiming are in dire need of fixing, leveling up is obtuse and painfully slow, and the general gameplay was the pinnacle sometime in the 90's. You can jump though, so that's novel. From software seem to have missed the point that games are supposed to be fun, they should really take some notes from more sophisticated games like The Witcher or Cyberpunk, Elex etc
It's a game built to frustrate, one that punishes you if you attempt to wring any enjoyment out of the world they have built.
If you have a masochistic streak, enjoy games that lack any sophistaction, or just harken back to the gaming era when games were hard because that was the limitation of the hardware then this is for you. Otherwise hang on to your cash, there will be much better games to spend it on soon.",3,6
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I'm always the type to laugh off and disregard scores of either 10 or 0 because very few games either are revolutionary instant classics or irredeemable garbage, but after 116 hours of play time (yes, I not only actually played a game before reviewing it, but completed it before I left a review like a sensible human being,) Elden Ring gets a 10.

I became familiar with the souls formula back in 1996 while playing King's Field II, and over the years, FromSoft games have become more refined with each subsequent entry. Each game that they've released has provided a great balance of something that feels familiar, but with a little more to consider. There's been a slow, natural evolution in their design principles that have very rarely disappointed. So it's with 26 years of experience with FromSoft's entries that I feel comfortable saying that this comes as close as we've ever seen to these design principles being perfected.

The leap in approach between each souls game has never been this substantial. Whereas before you had to dedicate yourself to mastering a very specific path through the world, Elden Ring provides an experience where you grow to learn the world on your terms and in the order that you choose. The guiderails are still in place, but you're encouraged to step over them, and the feeling of ""what's around the next corner?"" is actually somehow exponentially increased with this new open-world design.

And speaking of open-world games, I typically don't enjoy them because they devolve into henpicky busywork where you're only playing a game to meet a quota, and exploring is typically unrewarding in both an emotional sense, and in a material sense in the way of lacking rewards. In Elden Ring, your time is never wasted if you check around the next bend. The world is large, but it doesn't exist just to create the illusion of scale; there's something to look at or find in every corner that further contributes to the experience.

A grand majority of the negative reviews that I've seen have been from people who so clearly hate souls games because they're challenging and have been parroting the same talking points for years.  ""The games are designed so poorly"" actually means ""I can't fulfill my power fantasy by walking into a room and effortlessly killing 50 enemies"" ""I have enough stress in my life and I don't need to play a hard game because games are supposed to be fun"" actually means ""I have too much pride to learn a game on its terms because I should be in full control of the experience."" And finally, ""these games are so bad"" and anything similar to that notion actually means ""I've never played any of those games, but people have said that they're hard and that doesn't interest me, and I'm tired of hearing about them because their popularity offends me.""

If you're having a bad day, just read a few of the negative user reviews. You're going to notice a lot of whining children who've clearly never beaten, let alone played a souls game recycling the same handful of hilarious points. I had to take my dog to the vet for surgery today and I was feeling a bit down, but scrolling through these user reviews and seeing ""WHAT KIND OF SICK INDIVIDUAL ENJOYS GAMES WITH IMPOSSIBLE DIFFICULTY?"" with a 0 scored attached really brightened my day. I've had the time of my life playing Elden Ring, and Miyazaki and the rest of the FromSoft team are laughing all the way to the bank while you drench yourself in your own tears throwing a tantrum.

Elden ring is a masterpiece in its combat, storytelling, (open) world design, and music

the combat is simple yet the actions of the enemies makes ever single desicion in combat important,
do you strike now or bait out their attack first so you dont take the risk of trading damage?
do you heal now or maybe wait one more hit so you dont waste your limited healing recourses?
every moment in combat has a desicion to be made and that makes the combat never boring because you are always on high alrets on what your next move should be.
there is also a massive amount of options to consider when partaking in combat
what kind of weapon will you use, a greatsword with amazing range or perhaps a kitana smaller but faster and easier to evade with
how much armor will you wear, will you put a lot of heavy armor taking less damage however being more difficult to dodge with?
perhaps your feeling like long range options, a bow or crossbow function diverently and and multiple way of attack and arrow types which are all useful.
magic more your thing? have 2 different version in sorcery's and incantations both of which have powerfull offensive abilities and more passive supporting and defensive abilities
you options in this game are insane and all of them are viable and i haven't even covered all of it like the ashes of war which can completely change how you use a weapon.

The main story of elden ring is a simple but effective one its when you start reading the descriptions of the items, armor's and weapons you collect and look closely at the world around you is when the smaller details of the story are shown and the fact you can get the basic premise of the story if you wish or delve more deep into the story to uncover what trully happened is amazing.

this game has the best open world out of any video game i have ever played
the previously mentioned storytelling is one of many reason but there is so much more
open world games have for a long time carried the stigma of them being empty or having nothing to do expect reach missions
elden ring has a massive world to uncover and thankfully it is never boring or not helpful
you will always find something that will help you in your future journeys like new weapons, armors or ashes of war which massively shake up the gameplay.
these are also very well placed and spaced, there is no place or area in elden ring that does not hold something either interesting or helpful
it perfectly filled with goodies to collect and enemies to conquer

the graphics may indeed not be the greatest on the market however that was never the intention of the developers of elden ring (FromSoftware) they let the beautifull design and amzing art direction carry their games and elden ring has both in spades.
no 2 area's looks alike and all of it feel like a different world to explore
a lot of this games design ties back to the storytelling and the world crafted within its story is beautifully crafted

what a lot of people consider a negative in this game is it's difficulty
but this is no random occurrence by poor design FromSoft has stated multiple times they aim to create hard games and they want their players to overcome the challenges set before them
the difficulty in elden ring is perfectly crafted (for the most part) all enemies have a wind up to their attacks that shows when, how and where to dodge
THIS is video game difficulty done right
there is no cheap enemy that ignores the rules of the game to cheapshot you, there is not isntant kill attack that you cannot avoid.
by using death as a learning tool the player will slowly learn how to properly evade and conquer the enemies before them, as long as they never give up.
it's not a matter of live and death, its about what breaks first.
your will or the barries in your way

the one objective problem this game does face (at the moment of writing this review) is the frame rate problems
this game is stuck at a capped 60FPS and will sometimes dip to 45 for a second this happens maybe once every 20 to 30 minutes
this isn't a massive problem (not to me at the very least) however it is still a problem that needs fixing
FromSoftware is steadily pushing out more updates to help out this problem which hopefully shouldn't exist in the near future.

and to the person considering buying this game, please read both sides of the reviews and see which side is clearly trying to review bomb this game over things it was never meant to be or has no control over and look at the side giving detail on why this game succeeds in what it sets out to do.

miyazaki and the entire fromsoft team has trully outdone themselves here, for any fan of their work or newcomer this is their masterpiece and i cannot reccomend it enough.
all in all elden ring is a beautiful, intense, expansive and immersive masterpiece that i implore any fan of video games to try out",3,6

Its not a photorealistic graphicscard stresstest where every detail down to the sweat rolling down your characters cheek is megacrisp. But does it really need that? Its a unique artstyle with a lot of soul and character to it, and it carries itself beautifully. (Performance issues aside (those will probably be fixed soon anyways)).10/10.

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,"Honestly didn’t have fun. I expected this to be a step up from the other FromSoft games. However, the movement is the same, the bosses are the same weird FromSoft design they’ve always been, the mechanics are still somewhat clunky, and there’s still very little story to be had. If you like DSgames then you’ll like this too but as a long term fan I really wanted this to be difficult but better in all the other ways too.",3,6
"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"I wanted to like this game as someone that platinum'd the previous titles and played through multiple times but it just misses the flow the previous games had and artificial difficulty, especially in endgame hinder any fun.Bosses are too fast spamming aoe, spam ultimate oneshot moves, tank insane amount of damage and more.Either have a slow, tanky and hard hitting enemy, a fast low health hard hitting enemy or a fast, high health but low hitting enemy, that is balanced not what elden ring does hereI have beaten malekith last i played, tried malenia and am now am at a point where i lost all interest, not even planning on making a new character playthrough with a different build as i would normally do.Lazy, cheap and overtuned design, recycled music themes and bosses and more.This game falls under the same trope of being overhyped but not satisfying.Too bad that other reviewer are biased and scared of the community as of past embarrassments and falsy give this game top notch reviews despite major and obvious flaws.If you played other fromsoft titles and expect a good time, forget it until some patches come out, you wont find what you are looking for despite performance issues that might get fixed.dissapointment can't even describe what i feel on this game .",3,6
"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is my first FromSoft game. I think I might have played Dark Souls 1 when it FIRST came out for like two hours before quitting and never picking it up again (I say this just to show my lack of any experience with FromSoft games) but Elden Ring has completely immersed me in a way few games are able to do anymore. I used to LOVE open world games, but the last few years they’ve become a chore to get through, I’m not invested in the story, and it’s just endless fetch quests. Elden Ring has completely reinvigorated my love for open world games and what they can accomplish. This game is HARD- like I died at least 80-100 times on one boss. But, it rewards perfecting a strategy and learning how each boss moves and when you finally do win in a hard fought battle, the satisfaction and happiness lasts long afterwards because you know you didn’t just have to button mash to get the win. I think I played a full 16 hours yesterday and didn’t want to put it down but needed to sleep. I woke up and immediately couldn’t wait to start playing again. If you want a real challenge and the immense satisfaction of overcoming some of the hardest boss fights I’ve ever faced in gaming, I highly recommend this game. I think after I play through a new game plus I’ll try the other FromSoft games",3,6
"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Thank you FromSoft for not making a dumbed down game catered to the entitled and lazy community. A lot of crying going on about game design aspects like UX being nonexistent, and not having a quest log... really? It's a unique game design, deal with it. There are some performance issues yes, but it has in NO way ruined my experience, hope they iron out the kinks and then it will be perfect.
This game is genius, and truly hope they don't cave in to the negativity. There are plenty of hand-holding games out there. This is my jam and I am loving every minute of it.",3,6
"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Miyazaki managed to create the absolute best game ever, he did it, the absolute mad man. I just don't get how or why people are review-bombing this masterpiece, it's just so sad and pathetic.",3,6
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"An absolute masterpiece. It made me fall back in love with gaming. I see a number of negative reviews about outdated graphics &amp; whatnot but honestly it is still a large, beautiful open world with lots of places to explore &amp; loot to be discovered. Some bosses can appear impossible &amp; yes you’ll have to grind your level up to compete with them but that’s all part of the fun. From Software want you to go off and explore to level up so you can find places you’d never previously thought of going. Think I spent the first 15 hours of the game just in Limgrave (the starting area) exploring every nook &amp; cranny. I was simply discovering new locations within Limgrave like; Dungeons, Caves, Points of Interest &amp; new Sites of Grace. This game is all about taking risks to reap the rewards. I won’t put any spoilers as I want players to experience it for themselves but take my word for it when I say it is a work of art. From Software have certainly made the best game I’ve played in many years!",3,6
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"Even if Dark Souls / Bloodbourne are 10 (which is not true)...
Elden Ring brings us
obviously worse UI and UX -1
unoptimized performance -1
same old story (Martin's touch barely exists) -1
and worst of all, worse enemy design -1 or -2
The good part? Gigantic world and better exploration.

That makes it 7-8 at best. Where does the 9 and 10 come from?

And don't forget most players expect better combat design, but it gets MUCH worse than before with bad and shifting view angles, long-reach multiple combos to render most strategies useless, and deliberate AI that makes every boss fight a time-and-energy-consuming attrition war. In the end, most players rely on only a few specific weapon arts or spells , rinse &amp; repeat. This doesn't feel okay for a combat-centered game, especially not for the well-known Soul-game genre.

BTW don't trust those who say no issues with PS5 version. Frame rate is so obviously not stable under performance mode (sometimes the game even stutters a bit), and this potentially affect your dodge precision.

Honestly, giving this game ""10"" means either the reviewer is strongly biased toward the Soul franchise, or just got the game for a few hours.

Upon further deliberation I decided to lower the score once again, due to the fact that the narrative techniques and riddle design obviously do not go hand-in-hand with its openness and vastness. Many NPCs give no or very ambiguous directions, and very likely appear in places the players have been to; as a result, the ""chore"" or ""fetch boy"" feel is even stronger than other open-world games even when there are only a few ""side-quests"". Riddles like looking for a certain animal never specify a range, combined with the fact that they can climb up the tree, fly in the sky or be invisible. And the instant-death stupid chariot stuff that make players an idiot -- mere  trials and errors. All of the above are not challenges to players' intelligence or observation but just tedious tortures. Giving this game a 10 is like encouraging the designers to keep such meaningless and time-wasting tricks.",3,6

Ignore the trolls reviews binging this game, it’s a masterpiece.",2,4
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"One of the most engaging and enthralling experiences I've ever had. I've never been much of a souls player, but I have enjoyed difficult games in the past. I've speedrun a few games in the past too, with Sekiro being my introduction to the series. Coming from relatively difficult games like Cuphead, Sekiro, Hades, and Sifu, Elden Ring did an amazing job making me struggle and feel weak at first, but it does something that games like BOTW could never do for me, which is making me feel like I am getting stronger and progressing. It wasn't just my items and HP that were getting better, it was my entire character. I became so much more skilled than I could re-run all of limgrave with no issues on a new character, but being able to go back to limgrave in the end-game and one-shot some enemies gave me struggles early on was so satisfying. For me, this is a 10, because I haven't been this into and enthralled in a game since my teenage years when I played Skyrim, and it brought me as much enjoyment as I've ever had in a game.",2,4

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This game has 97/100 because the professional reviewers actually played past the first major boss before they left a review.If you like the standard AAA formula of 5 hours of tutorials followed by a bunch of side quests dumped on your map to walk between point A and B then this game is probably not for you.If you want to be able to kill every enemy straight away as soon as you meet them without practicing or having the discipline to leave it and come back when you're ready then this game is probably not for you.If this game is not for you then that's ok, but the game is not ""unfair"" or ""outdated"". It's very fair, but it requires patience, discipline and some intelligence to actually try doing something else if the thing you're doing is too difficult (people complaining they spent 40 tries on a single enemy, perhaps explore a different area first?)If you persevere past the first major boss then you'll probably think this game is 10/10.

Yes it's only a moderate upgrade to DS3 graphics and the gameplay is very similar to previous FromSoftware Souls games but what did users expect it to be? Of course that's what it is. All the gameplay footage and teasers showed exactly that. Why would all these users giving it a 0 or 3 think it was supposed to be something that it has never claimed to be? Again, if you like previous Souls games, this is a fantastic entry. It has all the mechanics explored in DS, Bloodborne and Sekiro thrown into a fun and addictive open world platform. If you disliked those games, you'll dislike this one. If you're simply giving it a 0 score because it was ""overhyped"" then you weren't paying even a little attention to its development. If you expected ""Skyrim"" gameplay or ""Horizon"" graphics then you know nothing about FromSoftware.

"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"First things first, this is Dark Souls. Not Dark Souls in the way Bloodborne and Sekiro are, where they change up key gameplay elements to keep the game fresh, Elden Ring when not on a horse is just Dark Souls. I've always found that Froms gameplay evolutions in both Bloodborne and Sekiro (although I never completed Sekiro) were a lot more fun to play. They still had that challenge of Dark Souls but were just a bit more focused making the challenge a bit more amped up and harder to cheese. That said Dark Souls gameplay its still good, just not as good as other From gameplay systems for me.

So let's take on the new elements. Chiefly the open world, for me it doesn't really add anything, in fact one of my favourite elements of From's games was their intricate, interconnected, world designs and whilst there are still fragments of that in Elden Ring the overall discovery is much more basic. I'm not sure why just giving an open world with no inherent direction makes it a master piece, this doesn't really have the curios of BOTW, or the grand spectacle of RDR2 it's just kind of there for you to wander around, more often than not you will find a boss to fight at the end of any given exploration. No cunning shortcuts to get you there just a boss. The shortcuts are still alive and well in larger dungeons, although to a lesser degree than prior From Games.

I'm also not loving the lore as much as prior From games, Demon Souls was this gothic bleak dead world and that spilled into Dark Souls that refined it, Bloodborne was an eldritch horror within a victorian city gone mad, Sekiro had an almost mystical vibe to it. Elden Ring is kind of meh, it's pretty in places and there are some awesome views but overall it failed to capture me quite as much as prior titles.

None of these things are really bad, and are likely more down to my preferences really, but one things that is truly bad is the performance. foliage textures pop in about 20 feet in front of you, the frame rate shakes like a bobblehead on a washing machine during an earthquake, and a lot of the textures are pretty basic. Elden Ring has some great moments from it's art design, but as a technical piece its lacking considerably. (Played on PS5)

I'm probably being a bit harsh on Elden Ring, it is a good game still, but I just preferred From's other games, and my fond memories of those titles just kept reminding me how I vastly preferred their tight interconnected faster paced games vs this slower, wider, rather loose one.",2,4

"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"First things first, this is Dark Souls. Not Dark Souls in the way Bloodborne and Sekiro are, where they change up key gameplay elements to keep the game fresh, Elden Ring when not on a horse is just Dark Souls. I've always found that Froms gameplay evolutions in both Bloodborne and Sekiro (although I never completed Sekiro) were a lot more fun to play. They still had that challenge of Dark Souls but were just a bit more focused making the challenge a bit more amped up and harder to cheese. That said Dark Souls gameplay its still good, just not as good as other From gameplay systems for me.

So let's take on the new elements. Chiefly the open world, for me it doesn't really add anything, in fact one of my favourite elements of From's games was their intricate, interconnected, world designs and whilst there are still fragments of that in Elden Ring the overall discovery is much more basic. I'm not sure why just giving an open world with no inherent direction makes it a master piece, this doesn't really have the curios of BOTW, or the grand spectacle of RDR2 it's just kind of there for you to wander around, more often than not you will find a boss to fight at the end of any given exploration. No cunning shortcuts to get you there just a boss. The shortcuts are still alive and well in larger dungeons, although to a lesser degree than prior From Games.

I'm also not loving the lore as much as prior From games, Demon Souls was this gothic bleak dead world and that spilled into Dark Souls that refined it, Bloodborne was an eldritch horror within a victorian city gone mad, Sekiro had an almost mystical vibe to it. Elden Ring is kind of meh, it's pretty in places and there are some awesome views but overall it failed to capture me quite as much as prior titles.

None of these things are really bad, and are likely more down to my preferences really, but one things that is truly bad is the performance. foliage textures pop in about 20 feet in front of you, the frame rate shakes like a bobblehead on a washing machine during an earthquake, and a lot of the textures are pretty basic. Elden Ring has some great moments from it's art design, but as a technical piece its lacking considerably. (Played on PS5)

I'm probably being a bit harsh on Elden Ring, it is a good game still, but I just preferred From's other games, and my fond memories of those titles just kept reminding me how I vastly preferred their tight interconnected faster paced games vs this slower, wider, rather loose one.",2,4

FromSoft got too popular, and in a desperate attempt to appeal to the r*dditors who weren’t good enough to progress in the game, they patched the game and nerfed the enemies/bosses.

I have 2 great runes and I am just taking my time with the rest of the bosses. I want to find everything I can. The amount of mini bosses is amazing as well. So many cool encounters.

10/10",2,4
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Bottom line: the game is overhyped. I have been playing From Soft games since Kings Field 1.

Design: This is more of the same, and absolutely just dark souls in an open world. It is refreshing to see a game without a bunch of icon chasing and relies on player exploration. One caveat and problem here is that the payoff when clearing out extremely tough areas is nonexistent, often times rewarding you with mediocre items, this is the same for slightly hidden items, they are just mediocre save for a few instances. The sense of exploration created by their design choices are great, what you get for exploring isn't, but still, it's a fun challenge.

It works from a design standpoint, but as a fan I'm tired of being sold the same decade old game engine ALONG with re used enemy animations, assets, and move sets. The armors, weapons, all of it are literal reskins they have already used across 4 games. The least from soft could do is update the archaic UI.

Technical:  The game runs poorly on PS5, there new patch 1.002.001 actually made the game WORSE. with a shorter draw distance and more pop in, but the framerate is still as bad as before, and now the game looks and runs worse.

Bottom Line: this game as is technically, is not what the mainstream outlets are saying. It's a technically flawed dark souls game set in an open world. If the technical issues were actually fixed on this game reusing so much content from old games, I'd say it's a solid 8.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"TLDR: Elden ring is FromSoft’s best game this **** is **** Incredible. 10/10 I explain why below.

The world of Elden ring is really **** huge with tons to do man, i ain’t even kidding or lying to you the world feels so natural and doesn’t even got that feeling of “oh a game dev put this **** here whatever” and it’s got so many hidden locations in this **** man it’s really a marvel fr. the graphics are really great too overlooking the second region of the game after clearing your first legacy dungeon is staggering, now it ain’t gonna be for everyone, a lot of people like colourful **** and all that, but this game isn’t that, and it’s not suppose to be. like you’re in a DYING and ROTTING world and people are comparing this **** to like horizon and other open world games when this just different this world is suppose to be dull and dying and it does this setting really well.

The story is good too, being a From Soft game most of the lore is pretty hidden and not gonna be fed to you through massive amounts of cutscenes, but instead it’s gonna be given through item descriptions and small dialogue with side characters, personally this don’t bother me, it makes getting invested into the world and plot more immersive, i personally don’t like being lore dumped with 5 minutes worth of cutscenes at a time but this is preference i guess, the only lore you get when you start is “yo listen you need to go out and become the Elden lord cuz the world is dying cuz the elden ring broke. ain’t no one out here able to fix it so you do it” it’s simple enough to start but as you go through the game you learn the about the different factions and groups and **** and how the world came to be and how they connected to the bigger world and what happened to certain characters, it all goes so much deeper than led onto be in the beginning it’s some crazy ****.

The combat in this game is so refined its the greatest the souls series has seen yet i’m not cappin, this **** is incredible every weapon has unique animations and combos it did away with r1 spam from previous games and really made you think about what moves to do at what time, you have 2 different jumping attacks on every weapon, heavy attacks that have 2-3 hit combos, all weapons have light attack combos with faster weapons having 4-8 hit combos and slower weapons having 3-5. you have weapons arts that can be switch out with ashes of war that can be found in the world there’s so many unique builds you can do with this system man, you can take any weapon “with the exception of legendary weapons” and turn it to scale with different types of damage, there’s so many different options with this systems is actually insane i’m telling you man. The games difficultly has been made in a way that i’m pretty sure anyone can beat it that ain’t to say it’s not hard for veteran souls fans cuz it is, the bosses here will make you their **** man i’m not joking. But nah, i’m talking about using the spirit summoning system. it’s use to take boss aggro is extremely useful to a lot of newer players and the best part is, you don’t even have to use it if you don’t want to, it’s completely optional. during my playthough, i found that the summon is too strong so i straight up ignore it for boss encounters it’s made the game really accessible i think that more people than ever are gonna actually be able to beat this game. Technical wise i have heard somethings that aren’t very good about the game, being perfectly honestly the game doesn’t run that well, especially with what i got setup “i7 9700k, 16 GBs of ram and a asus Strix gtx 970” with this set up i can run the game at 60fps on all low graphic settings, most of the time, i’ve had many frame dips in certain locations and i’ve had the game crash twice over my 30 hours of playing when i Alt Tab on pc so far. FromSoft has addressed these issues and promised an update “in the near future” so hopefully these problems fix soon. as for bugs, i haven’t experienced any in 30 hours, non at all maybe i’m just lucky ion know. no glitches either but i have heard of some torrent glitches like bugging out getting onto him and stuff, but i personally have not had any of those issues. i think i talked bout everything, ion wanna spoil anything cuz this game is honestly at its best going in blind and just discovering **** i’m tellin you guys this **** is gonna be remembered its really one of a kind, it’s does so many different things and it prefects all the things it does. Personally this game is a 10/10, i’m going to assume that within a week or so the performance issues will be fixed so i have no real complains other than that.",2,4

The enemies are expectedly hard, and all unique to their regards. Even if an enemy is overwhelming, you can always leave to level up and come back when you have better gear. Being able to hop into your buddy’s world or vice versa, and taking on areas/bosses add a whole other level of enjoyability.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"Definitely not a 0, nor a 10.

Much like with Breath of the Wild, you set out and create your own path in a vast open world. No map riddled with markers and points of interest. It’s up to you, the player, to figure out and unfold the game world. Because of this open world design, you can avoid enemy encounters and when you meet a hard boss, you can fall back and prepare for your next confrontation by defeating a variety of enemies (both small and big) in the open world to level up your stats and/or gear.

Unlike Breath of the Wild though, Elden Ring doesn’t do much in terms of changing the true and tried combat mechanics of the Souls games; for better or worse, depending on how much you like Souls games. Personally, I’ve tried multiple Souls games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro and most recently Demon’s Souls Remake. Out of that list, only Sekiro stuck with me. I feel like Sekiro nailed the combat mechanics best and the grappling hook made traversal fun. In that regard I wish Elden Ring played more like Sekiro than Dark Souls.

I can’t help but compare this open world design to Breath of the Wild and because that game did it so well and came out in 2017, I’d hoped it would take more inspiration. Not being able to climb, or glide down high terrain feels like a step backwards. Such a huge open world should be easy to traverse. Of course you can fast travel to previously discovered ‘Sites of Grace’ and you can summon your trusty steed at any point in the open world; but discovering new places and figuring out how to get to landmarks far in the distance, is more frustrating than fun. On top of that, the game doesn’t have much interactive ways to play around and experiment with in the open world. It is there where the game falls short for me, as the journey should be as fun, or maybe even more fun, than reaching the destination. All of this takes away from the immersion, which makes me wonder if the open world is really just a way for new players (like me) to take away some of the intimidation that comes with the Souls genre.

Then there are the performance issues with framerate, on every platform and regardless of how powerful it is. It feels disappointing, because this game deserves (and demands) to be polished. Just like the lack of interaction in the open world, it takes away from the immersion.

There have been better games that could’ve been used as an inspiration for this game, by other developers AND by FromSoftware themselves. I understand the disappointment many players feel and I think this game will be very divisive for Souls veterans and new players alike.

As I said before, I tried multiple Souls games and only Sekiro stuck with me. I’m not blind for all the missteps and issues Elden Ring has, but I keep wanting to get back to playing the game. The option to retreat and prepare for the next confrontation has eliminated the intimidation I’ve always felt playing Souls games and for the first time I actually enjoy getting my ass handed to me, only to return later to exact my revenge with my newfound skills. It feels extremely rewarding and over 30 hours in I still feel like I’m making progress, without worrying about the end destination.

Although I feel like Sekiro had better combat mechanics and that Elden Ring should’ve taken more inspiration from Breath of the Wild in terms of traversal and interaction with the open world, I thoroughly enjoy my time with Elden Ring. Being able to retreat to the open world from difficult enemies, to prepare for the next encounter, takes away a lot of the intimidation and stress I’ve always felt playing Souls games. The technical issues with the framerate are a shame and will hopefully be resolved in a future patch, but they are not enough to refrain myself from enjoying the game.",2,4

Game rating 8.5",2,4
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"The critics have got this one wrong.

Elden Ring has suffered from timing. This was a game we needed during the pandemic not after, and a game that needed to be released before Sekiro – from which its gameplay is a downgrade; before the Demon’s Souls remake – from which the graphics are a downgrade; and far closer to Breath of the Wild - which it hasn’t fully understood desperate liberal plagiarism. Elden Ring, and it is disappointing to write this, feels much more like a large-scale fan-made Dark Souls 3 mod for Breath of the Wild than it does the next artistic offering from Miyazaki &amp; co.

It is difficult to pinpoint what, if anything, is actually new. The gameplay is a mirror image of Dark Souls 3 save for the guard counter, which is an easy and accessible miniest of mini-game versions of Sekiro’s poise system. The open world style of legacy dungeons and procedural dungeons is lifted straight from BotW  - if only the crucial beauty of allowing the player to traverse anything and everything were lifted too, there’s nothing elegant about watching your avatar hop clumsily around a slightly too lumpy rock. Those reviewers calling this a new benchmark for open-world games can’t have played The Witcher 3 or Breath of the Wild.

Sekiro proved that unique combat systems can not only exist but thrive within the broader souls-like formula. With Elden Ring, From have returned to the tried, tested, and frankly hackneyed. After the three-year wait one can’t help but be a little disappointed not to be enjoying the next step in the evolution of souls-like combat.

While Link’s ability to climb or Wolf’s grappling rope are sorely missed when roaming Elden Ring’s open world, it is a deeper Dark Souls mechanic which most noticeably grates: loot. Almost every weapon you pick up in Elden Ring will be worse than what you currently have equipped because you’ve likely been upgrading that as soon as you possibly can to take on some of the extraordinarily difficult bosses. Imagine if, rather than repeatedly travelling back to vendors to sell most of what you pick up to keep upgrading your Uchigatana, you simply kept finding better Uchigatanas, or better yet a variety weapons that you could pick up and start slaying with. Wouldn’t this make slaying mobs in the wilderness more enticing?

It frustrates to find an exciting bit of gear but feel that using it will retard your progress in the game as enemies will now die in four hits rather than three. A defence of this system may be that one is intended to replay the game using different builds. However, there is far too much repetitive travelling for this to be as limitlessly replayable as the Dark Souls series or Bloodborne.

Perhaps Miyazaki has given birth to the golden cow of the souls-like and now needs to stop milking it. While Sekiro was a masterpiece that proved impenetrable for too many, Elden Ring is your favourite band selling out with a pop song that more people can enjoy but may well disgust a good chunk of the fanbase. The commercial angle is confirmed by the comically apparent involvement of G.R.R Martin, whose presence is mysteriously eclipsed by his absence.

Elden Ring isn’t From’s best game, and it may well be their worst. What it is, however, is fresh souls-like content, which is always fun for as long as it lasts.

After a long string of 9 out of 10s, Elden Ring unfortunately feels like a 7.",2,4
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Honestly breathtaking. On PS5 I have had zero issues. I don't usually write reviews for games on here, but with the sad situation of salty game Devs and their salty fans creating new Metacritic accounts with the sole purpose of review bombing a brilliant game, I wanted to add my two cents.

First off, more than one game can be good at any given time. I feel like a lot of people need to hear this. That being said, Elden Ring is one of the few games I have played in recent memory that not only lived up to the hype and promises made, but surpass both, greatly. It is absolutely stunning. FROM has created a world that feels so lived in. This isn't just an open world so it can say it's an open world game, it's an open world that actually doesn't feel empty. Which is shocking if you look at the size of the map! And there are things to discover or miss in every corner of that map. This adds so much to the exploration. The fact that it is left completely up to us, the player, how and where we want to play and/or explore is so refreshing. Just last night, I was running through and area I had been through countless times in my currently over 70 hours of play time, feeling like a God, when I encountered an enemy I had never seen, that promptly ended me and brought me down off my high horse. I was shocked, stunned, and absolutely giddy with excitement.

The gameplay is brilliant, they have been refining it over years, and anyone can see it. It is effortless in its execution. Are there changes that could be made? Of course, as with absolutely any game that has ever been made, especially so soon after release. Do they dampen the experience to a point where I, even slightly, don't enjoy the game? Not for even one second.

A lot of people have complained that the ""graphics are awful"" and that it's ""absolutely hideous."" These are absolute lies from people really looking for something to complain about. Are the level of the graphics the same as different games recently released? Can you see every strand of hair separately blow in the wind? No you can't, but bad, the graphics are most certainly not! The game is still beautiful!

The atmosphere, the story telling, the exploration, the actual game play, and how these all make you as a new tarnished feel while exploring the world for the first time, they are what make this game what it is, brilliant.",2,4
"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,"Thankfully for now it's very obvious that most people don't actually like this game, yes it sold over million copies, because lots of people were baited into buying it, because it was advertised as ""very accessible for new players"", but in reality it's just same as every Souls game, just with open world and most people don't like games where you have to die million times to learn move sets, most people don't find that interesting, it's very obvious that most gamers want good story, fun gameplay and challenging, but not too difficult combat. Souls games are way more than challenging, they are brutal and even with best gear you can die easily and for most people, this is not fun. Just speaking facts.",2,4
"Mar 15, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,"I finished the game and platinum it; however, it has many flaws. My first main complaint with the game would be that after visiting an area and getting the item from ruins and dungeons. The game does not gray or give you any indication that you have already visited that area in gotten all of the items that are there. Then you will notice that the sites of Grace which were pointing toward major boss battles. Still point for the exact same boss battle. Making you have to go watch a YouTube video on where to go next. This is outdated game design and should be criticized.. you get very few attack patterns there are only a few weapons that actually give you more than to attack patterns and yes you can add another attack pattern through an ash of War. Sometimes depending on what that Ash of War does. However, the game lacks a lot in combat on your side. Making combat overtime boring. Because you're just doing the same animations over and over and over. My third critique is that multiplayer is actually kind of difficult to figure out especially when the game first launched now I don't understand why it is so Antiquated I guess the programmers thought it would be too hard to program in the fact that you could just sit at a side of Grace and invite friends. But it is extremely difficult to hook up with friends and actually play around together. And explaining it is like explaining an algebra problem. Fourth is there is no Quest log or notes on what NPCs have said. So if you came across it and NPC who was a quest giver and you wanted to try to do the quest yourself and maybe you were trying to remember where to go well good luck you might have to write that down with your own hands. It is there is absolutely no story in this game for a game that has a famous author on the title. There is no story to be found here you might find lore videos on the internet. But it is it entirely up to interpretation and there is hardly any dialogue between any in NPCs in the game. My favorite joke is that you're only going to get five lines of dialogue. With every NPC you come across that's not entirely true but it's a good joke and remind you that you should not expect any story when going into this game in fact the story is entirely up to interpretation and that's not a story because it doesn't have any major at or plot points your character does not grow your character does not change in any major way. Anybody who says any other way is clearly not knowledgeable when it comes to how stories work. The game looks like it should have came out 5 years ago the graphics are lacking. It looks gray and outdated even on a PlayStation 5. It looks like it should have came out alongside Dragon Age Inquisition. If it would have come out around that time it would have been a lot better. However video games have matured the world is boring New Game Plus is very disappointing your first playthrough is going to be extremely fun. And you're going to be excited with the possibilities of what new game plus is but when you get your mine ball bearings took it away from you and you can't buy smithing stones. And you have to discover things that you discovered in the previous play through. For the second time around you're going to find yourself hitting the delete button especially if you want hundred percent it and got the Platinum. This game is overrated and the fans are extremely toxic. I will never buy another from soft game in the future it is a waste of time money and energy the only type of people who are into this type of game series are people who are into being dominated and frankly that is not me.",2,4
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"It's such an unfriendly game. I don't like to play while watching the strategy, but Eldenring is so unkind that it is impossible to progress the game without looking at the strategy. It's not just a question of difficulty. It's just too unkind. It's almost as unfriendly as a 90's game.",2,4
"Mar 20, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"Terribly boring game.  It's not that it's a hard game as mentioned in many reviews, it's that the point of the game is to memorize boss moves and learn after dying over and over how to avoid their attacks.

And that's it.

The graphics are nothing impressive, the story is boring, there's nothing to it than constant boss fights with no real payoff.

Also it's advertised as coop but really is not.  You can jump through hoops to summon a friend but they get no benefit from playing with you and if you beat a boss they disappear and you have to do it all over again.",2,4

"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"10/10 Doesn't do this title justice, and I don't mean that out of pure hyperbole.  This game sets a new high standard for how to create an open world title. Even if you are not a fan of the souls-like combat, just the act of roaming around the world and discovering things is worth the price of admission.",1,2
"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,Elden Ring is a very hard game to recommend the lore and the story and the overall world is absolutely amazing. However From Software continues with their arrogance and refuses to add an easy mode making this game a definitive skip for about 75% of gamers. It's really a shame since you can spend hundreds of hours in the game world. I can only hope for an easy mode down the line cause this game shouldn't be missed,1,2
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"The game every Souls fan and open worlds games fans looking for, a huge map with a lot of bosses, enemies, dungeons and there is something to find and explore in every corner
Elden Ring is a must to play game without doubts",1,2
"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,4,"I put in around 25 hours on the PS5.
I would say it is the best of the From Software games - with some improvements which prevent it from being quite so frustrating.  (like check pointing, more ""bonfires"")   But still - it is too frustrating to be fun after a while, or a worthy use of time.
I like the BOTW/Skyrim style of exploration and map reveal.
I did find it quite addicting - but in reflecting on my play sessions, I can't say I was really enjoying myself.
Graphics are poor.   Music is poor.
Same exact sound effects from the other souls games does not make it feel at all ""fresh"".

Over-rated and left me a bad taste in my mouth.",1,2
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"The game is fun, no doubt. The boss battles are exhilarating and there is a good variety of enemy types- each with their own distinct feel. There is an underlying story somewhere, but it is told in fragmented/disjointed parts that only the most ardent fans will actually care enough to explore. The graphics are terrible. The animations are terrible. And the game is glitchy and poorly optimized. It  feels like an early PS4 release title and does not have anywhere NEAR the style or the polish as other ""next gen"" games. With so many other great options, this is unfortunately a big miss on FromSoftware's part.

Poorly told story, unpolished game, with fun gameplay (not necessarily good, just fun) 6.5/10",1,2

Its a souls game with the ability to jump and that alone should seal the deal.  The gameplay is smooth and evolved, the exploration is amazing and there's even a swamp to top it all off.  Miyazaki really outdid himself this time.",1,2
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"The game has very minor pop ins with the landscaping. That is all. I have had zero frame rate drops on PS5… Zero… This game is an absolute masterpiece. It is definitely not a 0. Salty as scrubs don’t like this game. It’s brutal and hard. Sorry… I have put 16 hours into just a small area and there are dungeons, churches, caves etc… Exploring is like breath of the wild and there are important game items, weapons, armors etc to find. Exploring is absolutely wonderful. I was exploring and ended up in a cave I could not fast travel out of. I had to trek my way out and it was insane. Please do not believe the 0 scores. But I will warn you that the game is definitely hard. But… you can summon friends, npcs, and spirits. The game is absolutely a masterpiece. But again it will kick your butt sometimes. 10 out of 10 and I’m not even close to done.

Elden Ring is any Dark Souls fans wildest dreams. The only real drawback is the performance on PC and Xbox at the time of this review. Hopefully, that is addressed quickly.

This is one of my favorite games I've ever played.",1,2
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,I just can give this a 10. If I could I would give it a 20. Its the best game I have ever played and I am not a Dark Souls fan boy.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,Another dark souls game. Nothing new graphically. A few changes to combat make it interesting. It's the same old combat. I don't know what's so intriguing about this game. Nothing innovative.,1,2
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"The game is mediocre and trash af and mainstream media outlets once again proved that they are irrelevant and trash.

One of the things that Sekiro did the best for souls games was adding posture and finishers which made the bosses 10 times more epic than Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Now all of a sudden they just scrapped that and downgraded it to the first souls game. You kill those mediocre bosses and they just vanish that's it, nothing special. Yea there's some kind of a posture still in Elden Ring but it's nowhere near as good.

Another thing is the fantastic storytelling which Sekiro had and all of a sudden they felt that they need to not make a story and give us text as a lore. You should sit on your chair and read text... uninteresting af. Yea there's some cutscenes here and there but again, it's not nowhere near as good as Sekiro.

Graphics and animations are PS3 or mid PS4 level, even Bloodborne which is a 2015 game has better graphics than Elden Ring 2022.

Uninspiring map, level design and bosses which are the same as previous FromSoftware games with no innovation and improvements, basically more the same.

They just milking the formula. Mediocrity on every bit of the game.",1,2

It plays more or less like Dark Souls 3, perfect, I liked that game feel, why fix what wasn't broken.
Its graphics are good. I don't really get the problem people have here. Sure they are not photo realistic but who actually wants that?! The game still had me so stunned by visuals at some points I forgot what I was doing and died.
If you have not beaten a single other Fromsoftware game, maybe come back to Elden Ring when you have. If you don't want to be gate kept like that then sure go ahead, but you better have patience or look a few guides.",1,2

"Mar 18, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"I have never beat Souls/borne games but this one... After 133 hours of gameplay I have finished it and can finally say F.U to the Lord of blood….
Elden Ring is very immersive, you are in an awe with those majestic looking vistas. The character designs in this game are very well done, it kinda reminds me of Castlevania but has a punishing difficulty. The game is very difficult I think this is the most hardest RPG’s that I’ve play yet. It takes a lot of your time grinding you character to farm runes. Runes serves as currency in the game but also serve as experience to level your character. The game wants you to be patient and calm but sometimes those nerves will really get you, specially when you keep dying from an enemy/boss or an obstacle. Exploration is really what’s good about this game you can find more hidden secrets and areas just by exploring. Also there are no markers to the next destination for the main story line , I have to go search a wiki out of it just to finished the story.
This game isn’t perfect it also shares annoying technical issues with other games like the camera.
-The camera is one of your enemy when you are locking on to a target specially big ones it creates a weird angle that you can’t see enemies poise or the stance what strike it will do.
-Another one is the wall, enemies strikes sometimes can pass through a wall, even if that enemy is behind the other side of the wall, like your hit box is really wide that walls cant stop enemies from hitting you.
-Lastly and the most annoying is the delay response of controls whenever you are dodging and rolling or jumping specially when you are locking on to a target it sometimes doesn’t do what you want to do whether to dodge or jump or worst it gets delayed when you suppose to hit the enemies opening but your character keeps rolling because of the delay.
I have a love and hate relationship with this game sometimes I just want to give up, because some certain enemies are annoyingly difficult. I almost broke my keyboard because of rage. If you want to play this game and you are up to the challenge. Here is a tip , magic spells or attacks are OP in this game, during my playthrough I build my character as a battle mage I used every weapon or magic spells that I could find that has more damage just to beat this game. Also read a wiki if it doesn’t really hurt your ego.",1,2

Forget it, DS Remastered is a masterpiece in comparison with Elder Ring.You will hate it for no clear in game story (well that’s usual for FS), underwhelming complexity with no reward, very average graphics (well it not bad for FS games, but not in comparison with other) and open world which actually doesn’t make any sense in that game. As world’s lore is maniacally “foggy”, twisted and complicated and world itself provides you with veeeery few tips and hints about what happening, there is no desire or fun to investigate it at all. It mostly consists of empty areas and deadly mobs which you will grind day by day to make a next level up, so you can do same in next area. Also, most importantly, game is lagging on PS5 even in performance mode! Graphics mode is unplayable at all, as fps drops to a slide show, maybe that will be tuned a little by patches, but for the game where half second delay is critical this is totally unacceptable. Not recommend for a regular player who used to have good story/complexity/graphics/price balance.",1,2
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This game is among the best games of all time. If I could give it an 11, I would. What can I say that hasn’t been said already.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,Jesus. They went and did it again. They improved upon virtually every aspect of their previous titles. The world is gorgeous to traverse and explore.

"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is my first type of dark souls type of game i have ever played. The only reason i gave it a chance is because im a open world SNOB. At  first, I hated the game. I thought to myself why anyone would want to put them selves through this pain. But oh man, once you accomplish a boss, its the best feeling in the world. Everything gets easier from there on out too in my opinion. The open world is gorgeous and the enemies are all so unique. Never played a game like this before. 10/10 for sure.",1,2
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Does it have the latest graphics? No. Neither did Breath of the Wild or Mario Odyssey. Is the gameplay and level design masterful like those two? Yes.,1,2
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"The game is just incredible. The combat is amazing. The world is vast and full of itens and challenges. The dungeons are fantastic. The visual design is gorgeous. The best From Software game and one of the best games I’ve played. In my point of view, the frame rate problem is not critical and doesn’t  significantly the overall experience, but needed to be considered in my final rating.Don’t listen review bombs. It is a remarkable game and deserves its acclaim.",1,2
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Elden Ring is, as the critics are saying, a masterpiece. I think FromSoftware still has some improvements they could make to the way their multiplayer works, but it certainly is unique and the audience FromSoftware has spent the past 13 years cultivating seems to generally like it. It's just a bit unwieldy and difficult to grasp at first. But, as with all things, practice makes it much easier.

Beyond that criticism, there isn't much I can say against Elden Ring. It's open world is full of interesting and unique encounters. As you progress through the game, it constantly throws curveballs at you, so that you never quite know what to expect.

The combat is fun, action-packed, and exciting. It also requires forethought and planning - this isn't a hack'n'slash game. It's an RPG.

The graphics look great. I'm seeing people say ""the game runs terrible on PS5."" I have a PS5. I haven't seen anything ""terrible"" about the game I've been playing for the past 40+ hours. I've been playing it with friends who have PS4s. I've heard exactly 0 complaints from them about any aspects of the game's graphics. The art design is also spectacular. FromSoft really knows how to make an enemy that you see and immediately think, ""$#(@! I really don't know if I even WANT to fight that thing..."" Likewise, the music in the game really sets the tone of the world perfectly, and it amps up considerably during memorable encounters.

The story is very interesting, but it's told in a sparse and subtle way. If you have played FromSoft games before, you know this. If you haven't, you've probably heard it before. It honestly shouldn't be a surprise if you do literally ANY research into the game before you buy it (which you should always be doing - don't buy a game you know nothing about and don't buy a game based on a single trailer you watched on TV). The narrative is very open and freeform. It doesn't give you a questlog. Instead, you must actually LISTEN to NPCs and deduce what it is they require of you. There are no markers on the map telling you that ""the finish line for the side quest is here.""

I encourage anyone who likes RPGs or open-world games to check out Elden Ring. Do some research on FromSoftware games if you've never played one to find out if this is an experience you'll enjoy. This is the most accessible that a FromSoftware game has ever been, but that still doesn't mean everyone will like it.

Before you take one of the reviews that gives this game a 0 (which is, frankly, insane) seriously, be sure to check the poster's review history. Chances are high that they either made an account purely to give Elden Ring a 0, or they only give 0s to universally beloved games because...I dunno? I guess it makes them feel original or unique to have such an ""edgy"" viewpoint? I can only assume, after reading most of the 0-4 rating reviews, that these people have not played the game much, if at all, and/or are just bitter that other people are happy about a new Souls-like game when they've never enjoyed FromSoftware games.",1,2
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,This is the best game fromsoftware has made. Adds all the best elements of their previous games and amplifies them to 11.,1,2
"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Just wow. I’ve played the other Soulsbourne game maybe for a total of 5 hours, I just wasn’t really that into them. Elden Ring however, has me completely engrossed. FromSoftware hit a home run with this title. Games have flaws, and by no means is Elden Ring flawless. Those flaws however don’t affect gameplay in the slightest. If you’re able to ignore the **** on social media about this game, and just accept you’re going to die a lot until you figure things out, then this game will blow you away. Graphics may not be the best for a game released in 2022, but I haven’t found a game that just makes me stop everything and just look at the depth, the artwork, the sheer volume of detail put into these landscapes. Mob design is thrilling, I would be hard pressed to find the imagination going into these assets anywhere else.The story leaves a lot to your interpretation near the beginning and quest lines are hard to follow. I kept a notepad and pen with me to keep track of NPCs and locations. I haven’t done that for a game in years and it made me so excited. With that being said some quests left a bit to be desired, but the main story. I found myself wanting to find out more about locations and the main bosses. Gameplay. This is what it comes down to me for games. Bad story? If there’s amazing gameplay I can look past it. If a game has the best graphics the gaming industry has ever seen, but terrible gameplay, I won’t even bother. Elden Ring does not have the best graphics, or the best story (not saying either are awful, they are both great), but the gameplay just has you coming back for more. If you’ve died to a boss 20 times, you don’t give up because you think you have just figured out how to deal with his moves. You didn’t, but you try either way. If you get frustrated you can go off and fight smaller mobs and get stronger to meet that boss again. This is one of the best games I have ever played. That’s completely my own opinion, I was extremely happy with my purchase and the replay ability is there. So I will be enjoying this game for the foreseeable future.Graphics 8/10Story 8/10Landscape 10/10Gameplay 10/10",1,2

The open world setting is fantastic and creates a whole new level to approach the game from. Gameplay is still great. Runs much more stable on PS5 than it did on XSX for me but hopefully they is patched. Still has frame drops. I think they could have developed a new engine and really look forward to the next project taking the lessons learned from Elden Ring. A must play for Fromsoft fans and hopefully a great introduction for new players.,1,2

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I'm in love with EVERY single aspect of this game. The environment, the dungeons, the enemies, the Bosses (which the main ones are some of the hardest ever imo)... it's just breathtakingly beautiful. I've spent SO SO many hours just in the first area alone, just exploring, trying to solve little riddles and sometimes just standing there and appreciating the view. This game has SO MANY cool fight mechanics, SO MANY cool weapons - I think there's something for EVERYONE. I love that the magic system got an upgrade this time around. I think this could easily become my absolute favourite game of all time. It just doesn't get boring even one minute.

I've played it on PS5 (BEAUTIFUL) and Pc (I'm on the lower specs side there with only a 1060) and after the update it runs perfectly fine even on my old boy.
Another note: all this hurt little review bombing babys crying and rating a game like this with 0(!!) points.. you don't even deserve to play a game like this.",1,2

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"You should absolutely not listen to the review bombers. This game is incredible, and this is the first time I’m playing a fromsoftware game. Bad reviews are all saying the same thing : performance issues (oh noooo the game dropped to 50 fps for half a second while loading a new zone, literally unplayable!!), way too difficult (that’s the point of souls like game, they’re very hard), empty world (I personally disagree, there are plenty of things to find everywhere. You look a bit in a random zone and oh look, and completely optional dungeon for you to explore!), and bad graphics (really? The texture are pretty good, but the art direction is amazing. The overworks looks fantastic). Overall, you should probably listen to the actually reviewers for once and understand that the people giving it a 0 because it doesn’t run at 900 fps at are exaggerating. Pc player with a mid range pc here btw, never once felt like a death was caused by a random lag spike in 10 hours of playtime.

This is the first open-world souls game, with various vistas and corner to explore which will rewards you (or punished you) in a unexpectable way. A word of warning though, it's extremely addictive and challenging so make sure you only ventured in it in your free time.",1,2
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"I was never a fan of the souls game series. And even after completing the ps5 remake of demon souls I am still not fond of the series. I would give demon souls a 8.5 because I really enjoyed it and I never played anything like it but the slow paced constant death gameplay is not my cup of tea. Elden ring combines souls combat with a very dense and detailed open world and a decent story in my opinion. I haven't finished the game yet but I have watched gameplays and review and though I do see why many regard this game as the game of the year. In my personal opinion I find souls combat repetitive and somewhat boring. Don't get me wrong the open world is amazing, in fact most of the hours I put onto the game are me just exploring what the world has to offer. If you are into souls games give this a try. If you are not into souls games then this won't change your thoughts on the saga. 7/10 not my cup of tea, demon souls was better in my opinion, boring outdated combat, bad performance, okay story. What carries this game is the open world.",1,2
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"Certainly a good game, but performance should be better, even though it’s easy to over look whilst playing, and enjoying the story, gameplay and exploration. Certainly not a masterpiece, but a good game non the less",1,2
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden ring might be the most beautiful and detailed game world I've ever seen. Everytime I thought I saw all it has to offer I tuned a corner or went down a long elevator to a whole new area spanning out into the distance that I had no idea was even there. You can tell the world is hand crafted and not procedurally assisted by a computer program. Every little thing seems to have it's place and you don't see a lot of repeating assets or structures, everything was designed and put in place with a specific intention. It's the same amazing quality with the open world encounters, they all feel unique and each one feels new, not like most open worlds that have their world filled to the brim with cut n paste instances of the same 5 or 6 mission types and a map filled with quest icons leaving nothing as a surprise as to where and what you'll find. Fromsoftware deserves praise of the highest order for this masterpiece, I've never played anything quite like it. It's a souls fans dream come true the way this game was made, secrets everywhere that most people will miss and never even know was there without looking up a guide. Tons of enemy types, hugely varied environments that manage to blend perfectly, tons of bosses and mini bosses, super addictive progression mechanics like usual for them, it's a challenging game that doesn't hold your hand. It makes you earn your progress and earn secrets, it doesn't just hand it to you with a checklist of chores to do that takes you there. I dont use this word lightly but this game IS a masterpiece . Nothing is perfect but this is as close to perfection that I've seen in my 3+ decades of gaming and at this point it's probably the all around best game Ive ever played. Btw, FromSoftware, you guys are f Gods and all developers should model their games after yours. New gamers, If you want your hand held through everything, do not buy this, but if you want a rewarding experience that may be tough and frustrating at first but if you stick with it you will be rewarded far more than you can imagine and understand why the hype from the cult fanbase is so rapid and this dev is becoming so popular and loved. Like in the matrix, no one can be told what souls fandom is, you have to see it for yourself and it must be experienced to understand. If you make it through any of their games you'll likely be a convert for life and know why no one wants big shanges to cator to a wider audience. If I can play these games anyone can.",1,2
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"It is extremely rare in a sand box game to actually make you want to explore EVERY inch of a map after over 30 hours of playing I am still going over every hill, around every corner off the beaten path searching for everything and anything as this game rewards you for exploring in ways games by ubisoft or even breathe of the wild didn't do. The combat/difficulty of some bosses yes will cause you to be frustrated, have you turn around and continue your quest in another direction till you come back and get that sweet satisfaction of victory after levelling and memorizing a bosses move sets, that's just part of the game. No, not for everyone but if you're at the start of the game and feeling stuck and frustrated I urge you to grind out a few levels (just go explore guaranteed you've missed a lot) and keep at it, the games difficulty steeply plateaus out after the first boss as you get the hang of not panic dodging and this game absolutely just takes you away. Few games suck you in to the world like this one anymore and that's all without lengthy huge cinematic pieces that spoon feed you all the gaming storylines. Is a ten score a bit of an exaggeration? Maybe and ONLY due to minor graphical stuttering I've experienced but with the amount of people reviewing this game poorly simply due to their inability to learn how to play this game I feel good about bumping this from a 9 to a 10 since we all know games just come out a little rough at the start.

I just completed my first run on the PS5 with a full strength build, and can I just say wow… this game is amazing. This game has over 100 hours of content that don’t utilize recycled content at all. Every single area has new designs, new enemies, and new loot. I don’t understand how people can complain about the graphics, I played the whole game on my TV and I was blown away with how good the game looked. FromSoftware has incorporated new mechanics into the game while keeping the style of the Dark Souls franchise, and even managed small changes to mechanics from old games that offered quality of life changes that just make your life just a tad bit easier. While I will say this game will be too hard for a casual gamer, if you put the time in and don’t get too frustrated when your back is against the wall(I mean to say after you’ve died 100 times to the same boss which happened to me with a couple of them) you will fall in love.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"The game is definitely good but it’s just good. The ratings overhyped the game and now I’m just a bit disappointed Bc I expected such a top tier game. I’ve had more fun with other games but def a GOOD game. I loved the exploration aspect but you can also get lost with your next objective. Just last night I tried to join my friend but it would not work! It was so frustrating. It definitely ruined my night. People have been controversial on this but the graphics of the game are mid. It’s almost like they forgot that grass moves when you walk by it, or that capes don’t go through your body",1,2

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"I am 25 hours into the game and I want more and more and more. Being a player who usually likes to rush games filled with useless content, it IS something when a game convinces me that it is worth losing hours and hours looking for the smallest details hidden here and there. Elden Ring is kind of everything you have already seen in other Miyazaki games put together in a very smart way, plus an incredible blend of open world landscape and intelligent level design. Legacy dungeons are just what you would expect from a From Software game, with an added dimension of verticality and an even more complex construction, while outside the dungeons you have a vast world full of secrets and dangers (with respective rewards). After 15 hours I went back to the first area and found A LOT of things left to do, and none of them were boring or useless (unlike most open world games). The only problems are really ""just"" technical. I hope they will be solved soon enough, but it IS quite a scandal that a cross-gen game does not run properly on any platform. On horse there is massive pop-in, as well as when you respawn, and frame drops are far from being rare even in performance mode. At least, I found there is less input lag and much faster loadings (thanks to PS5 SSD). Dying is less painful now that you can respawn in less than 5 seconds.",1,2

On the performance side it has texture popping issues and some small frame drops here and there, other than that it runs on a smooth 60 fps on performance mode in PS5 and a little bit less smoothly on graphics mode.

12/10 would stomp out the first nine bosses easily again.",1,2
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"There have been a lot of negative reviews from people for whom this is their first FromSoft title who clearly did not know what they were getting into.  Do not listen to them.  They did not take the time to learn the game and its many systems and just bashed it for not being just another Jiminy Cockthroat open world that holds your hand every step of the way like the stuff Ubisoft puts out.

Elden Ring is the exact opposite of that.  It may not be the largest open world, but it is DENSE.  You cannot go more than 5 minutes without stumbling upon some old ruins, a random dungeon, a hidden secret, a roaming boss, or some other interesting encounter.  It's genuinely insane how much stuff they were able to pack into the game with so few repeats.  And this gets even more insane inside the big legacy dungeons, which are so sprawling and labyrinthine you could spend hours alone in each one.

Every single weapon looks great and feels good to use, and with the ability to change their damage types, attribute scaling, and special abilities using Ashes of War, the depth of character customization has never been higher.  These skills are also a lot more varied than they were in previous games, ranging from classics like stomp and spin attack to ranged elemental projectiles to duplicating certain spells to sucking in all nearby enemies with the power of gravity.

Combat has been improved in many other ways too.  Guard breaks now give use to your heavy attacks, jump attacks now have an actual input, and guard counters are some of the most satisfying attacks to land in the entire game.  Additionally, the best feature from Dark Souls 2, powerstancing, has returned with a vengeance, and it is glorious.

Spells received a similar increase in variety, with a wide array of interesting effects from a spray of chaotic firey bolts that builds a negative status effect on the user to a telekinetic flurry of thrown rocks to transforming into a tiny moon and launching yourself at an enemy.  Additionally, many quick-casting spells can be cast much faster after using another action, such as rolling, attacking, or casting another similar spell, while others can be charged to deal even more damage.

The only two legitimate problems the game has are the inclusion of Easy Anticheat and the rather poor optimization on PC.  At time of writing, I don't know if they've fixed that, but I run the game at medium settings on a PC that barely meets the minimum requirements, and I can play it just fine.  The game will occasionally freeze for a couple seconds, but I've never had it crash (though someone I was cooping with at one point did crash once), and occasionally large chunks of the screen will change to a solid color (usually either magenta or cyan) for a single frame, but these performance issues are rather rare and become less frequent the longer my session.

As for Easy Anticheat, it's probably the worst anticheat on the market today.  While I applaud them for attempting to solve the hacking problem, Easy is hilariously bad at what it does and basically only serves to make it more difficult for players to mod the game in fun ways like the Remastest and Nightfall mods for Dark Souls 1.

Overall, even with its performance issues, this is still easily the best game FromSoft has put out and a shoe-in for game of the year, possibly even game of the decade.  Hell, it even briefly held the title of second highest-rated game of all time on Metacritic, and still holds #11 at time of writing.",1,2
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"This game is overrated and I don't think so it should be something like game of the year 2022 on PS5 (maybe only in specific genre). I was so excited to play this game even if I´m not soul player but after few hours... I was wondering, am I playing the game that was so presented by media via amazing game trailers and in game footage??
The story looks really lazy and it´s not something what is giving powerful impulse to keep going. The game throw you inside the world just with basic information or without some further story which would give some more explanation what you doing here or who you are... Or maybe I missed something.
The next issue is the figures you meet in this game, they miss some big charisma or individual emotions, just walking puppets. Talking about enemies and its AI is so simple like just ordinary scripting of easy-hard fighting modes and nothing more, walking dead bodies.
Absence of some kind of life (living persons) makes you feel that you are walking thru the valley of doomed in one of circles belong to hell.
This is just about slashing of monsters, soldiers and other freaks on each corner. I can´t avoid a feeling in my self of repetitive action after some time. Like walking thru damn hell which makes you feel more and more bored and bothered in some moments. I have to use one citation: „dying 9000 times against a one million HP bosses all the time isn't fun…“.
About fighting and physics of your avatar, ough, the mechanics together with reaction times should be much more improved bcs it really s*cks in some moments (especially at fights). To the next, I think that most of players would welcome an option to choose difficulty level. One more thing, where is some dual-sense effect within PS5? I didn´t notice anything of the character during game play.
Graphic aspect of this game looks nicely done but not something of next-gen proportions or something what should blow out my mind.
In overall, it´s very good made and looks nice but it´s nothing what brings some new aspects within innovations. I think many things are taken (copied) from other games of same character and retransferred to this game. Example is the placing of messages during game play by other players, this is exactly the thing which has already been brought by Kojima into Death Stranding.
I have to admit this is not a game for everyone, you can love it or hate it, nothing between. I much more enjoy game play of Ghost of Tsushima than something like that. I don´t understand the rating of popular magazines, maybe good payed by other side...
This game has big potential be a game of games 2022 but this stood in some half way of idea to bring it on this level…",1,2

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"This is my biggest video-game-disapointment ever.
A dark souls game of extreme quality, that has been opened for the casual gamer. That was my expectation. Now, 30 hours of later, im deinstalling, and am not going to ever play this, nor buy any From Software game ever again...

Honestly: I regret the 30 hours of frustration i had, and the hilarious amount i paid for it.
It basically is just a fighting simulator. There is nothing more in this game. Run around, fight difficult to impossible (for me) battles, grind endlessly, progress extremely slowly, and, from time to time, discover items that may or may not be useful for you.
You will die a lot, lose all character progress regulairly, and generally, have no idea what this game is actually about. The story is non-existent, the world is extremely lifeless, and just filled with enemies that wait only or you, and the storyline will come to an end pretty fast, because you will just not be able to beat the bosses. At least, if you are a casual gamer iike me.
Which forces you to battle easy opponents forever, as rewards and character developement are hardly more than a cosmetic feature.

Of course there are ways to exploit the game, but as soon as i need youtube in a tab to achieve any chance of progression, a game has failed for me.

My last experience in this game, after exploring the whole starting region desperately, was a sorceress who finally enabled me to learn new spells. Which gave me hope, that the torture had come to an end.
And guess what: Those spells are far weaker than the weak ones, that you start with. Its a slap in the face, and im sure, that its an intended one.

If you give it you challenge yourself to finish this game no matter what (even watch a video of it to help). And if you do, at 10% of the adventure you will love it so much, it will be hard to like any other game. It did that to the rest of us.The video game is a masterpiece for so many players, is the game bad and we're blindfolded, or did you miss something?Instead of a review with points that you can find anywhere, I will give my feeling about this new FromSoftware:Amazing graphics, let's be honest, it is breathtaking.And I'm not talking about the definition of textures because you can find better textures in other games nowadays. The world they've created is literally stunning! The topography gives a lot of verticality to the game and you find yourself wanting to go to a place just because you can see a crazy looking castle or tree from afar. Animations, particules, shadows, wind in nature, enemies, there is so much to see.The gameplay itself is so flowless, switch from one weapon to another, invoking spirits, the hit/parry is brilliant. However the camera can be finicky sometimes, as well as the ""lock enemies"" that can sometimes lock an enemy far away while you wanted the one that is in front of you (happens sometimes but it can be anoying to die for that). The game alternate extremely well between outside environment and dungeons, forcing you to diversify your way of playing.The loot is great, just great. They found the right dose of rare equipment (it's not a Diablo III) and being able to find some randomly or by exploring. The rewards at the end of big side quests are crazy but of course require stats you can't afford yet and that's excellent because that let you enjoy the ones you have right now but still looking forward to it.The beginning story is good for now but hard to follow, there's so many names. Sekiro had an easier story to follow, so it feels like a downgrade to me here, but I'm not far into the story yet to judge.Overall an amazing game that I will discover for the next years to come.

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring is the ultimate gaming experience I have seen for an ARPG. Everybody talked about the greatness of the open world, but the game design completely separates this one from the other open world titles, where it tells the story about the world in a very subtle way. You actually play to see whatever the game tells you, and you will have very different experiences compared other players not because of choosing different dialogue options, but actually exploring the different paths in the game with your varying character. That is why I recommend people who haven't bought this game yet not to check anything about the content of the game from youtube other social media platforms before playing it, for at least 20-30 hours. After that you can somehow sense the patterns in the game, and you can benefit from some information online to make your life easier without spoiling the game for yourself.

This is a Dark Souls game, gameplay and objectives wise, as you will be clearing dungeons, killing some very hard bosses and die a lot until you finish the game, with a comparably under-skilled character having the only advantage with i-roll frames. But the caveat here which made me play this game and not finishing the DS games, is you won't be tracing through whole dungeons because your hand slipped in a life saving roll. Most bosses have respawn points nearby and although some may take time, the game progression is not related to most bosses, you can go somewhere else and try it later with better weapons, higher level etc. This removes the wasting time aspect of the game, with adding the feeling of freedom (I cannot emphasize enough) actually makes the perfect DS game.

I cannot understand the mindset of review bombers because of graphics. There are a lot of games which does not even have 3D graphics, like Hollow Knight (which I think is strangely similar to this game with the feeling of exploration and challenging bosses), and making it to masterpiece category. I understand the reasoning behind it (outdated textures cannot kill me) but I cannot remember the last time when a game made me say ""wow"" as Elden Ring (I have been playing games for more than 20 years, from every genre). It really made me feel mesmerized, stunned or disgusted (you will know the place when you see it) the moment I stepped into regions, and the bosses of the game are so well designed, I died multiple times while checking some of the details of the bosses' looks. And it can be played on a lot of platforms, mostly well. Frame drops here and there, some freezes occasionally are not much of an issue compared to fun I am having from this game.

A 10/10 game does not be a perfect software. It should be a video game where it makes me want to play because of the challenge, because of the situations that it put me in. It should make me both think and feel, and take me to a roller coaster of emotions. This game perfectly does that. I want everybody to have a taste from this game, one way or another, even if you won't play, just check the artwork, it may inspire you on your life somehow.

Although I really, really like Elden Ring, there are some people that I cannot recommend to. If you like cars and guns but not dragons, look for something else matches your taste in theme. If you want to see a lot of dialogue, map indicators or cinematic story telling, you may have a bad taste playing this game as it does not tell you much about what is happening verbally, or UI wise. If you are a person who really enjoys having a very fast and acrobatic character with cancellable actions in platformers or other action games, your Elden Ring character will feel clunky and you may not enjoy the action part that much. If you are a person who are on the very casual side of gaming, coming from mobile match-3 titles to AAA games this one may not be for you, at least at first. Other than that, just try this game one way or another, play at your friend's house, rent a PS or just get on Steam then refund it if you don't like it. Just play at least once.",1,2
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"The last time I felt this way about a game was when the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim came out- I was nine years old. Every day when I leave work, I have a smile on my face. I enjoy the drive home just a little more, because when I get home, I feel like a kid again. Past every cave opening, across every ridge, a small piece of adventure is waiting. Every other game feels like a child's game compared to Elden Ring. Other games feature simplistic combat that is mastered in minutes, they spell out their story so you don't have to pay attention, they give you a big red arrow telling you what to do next. Elden Ring doesn't do that, it roovides you a vast open world, dense with personality, and tells you ""go kill some ****",1,2

Exploration has never been so exciting and rewarding in a videogame before.Unlike previous soulsborne games, Elden Ring encourages the player to try out different playstyles (builds, weapons, equipments, consumables etc).Although at first it seems like the game isn’t beginner friendly, if the player is willing to learn, it quickly becomes obvious that the game is much more forgiving than previous From Software games. Usually there are a lot (sometimes it may even be overwhelming) of paths/choices to take. This means whenever someone is stuck, they can just find something else to do and come back later.The storytelling is not explicit but the lore is huge and really interesting. This makes figuring out the story (through dialogues, item descriptions, environmental storytelling) a unique and great experience.The bosses and enemies are designed very well. Being a from software game, it is obviously not an essy one, but definitely easier than their previous games.All in all it is an amazing game, a really unique and addictive experience. It’s not for everyone (just look at the mindless, salty reviewbombers), but it is worth a try.",1,2
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Single greatest game of all time. If you're a fan of LOTR, DnD, or anything fantasy stop reading this and go play this right now. I couldnt get into dark souls as I kept getting stuck. With this game it is very challenging at moments but being free to go off and get the item that can boost your stats or grind xp has helped me tremendously in progressing.",1,2
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is the my ultimate game, best game and only game for some time.  If you've never played a souls game you might not understand and that's OK because this is way more approachable than previous titles.
Its amazing, its deep, its long and it can be difficult but unlike past FromSoft titles you can go around harder parts, level up and go back... that is the easy mode along with blocking counters that can easily get you through early game and it almost makes early game too easy once you unlearn what you had to do in past titles.  The counters really don't help later on (I am about 60 hrs in and going slowly and enjoying every minute)
The only bad part of this whole release is that I may never go back to DS1,DS2or DS3 and that is a bit sad but this game is honestly all 3 and then some .",1,2
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"This game has been so much fun! I prefer to play with my partner and exploring the open world and fighting all the neat looking bosses has been a blast! I really enjoy doing all of the NPC quests and getting to know them and their back stories. My only gripe is that if you kill maybe a certain boss, or a certain amount of bosses in the open world, it will lock you out of playing co-op with the specific person you've been playing with.. It kind of does ruin the experience a bit.. If they were to change that, I'd give it a 10/10!",1,2

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"I think the question you should ask before purchasing Elden Ring (or reviewing it) is asking why you play video games? People clearly enjoy this game but to rate it as one of the best games of all time only makes you qualify that in some way. Almost every positive review I see discuss From Software and it's prior games as a way to explain why they love it. That's all well and good- but rating it as a 10/10 implies that a game succeeds by essentially ever measure. I simply can't comprehend that for this game. The combat is tough but rewarding and there are certainly amazingly designed monsters and battles. That's the draw it seems. I played for hours and that's just not enough for me. I simply wasn't having fun because it lacks the things I love in an RPG. Character development is non-existent and your initial character choice makes little difference in the long run. The overall story is extremely vague and expects you to pick up a lot via context clues but unless you are familiar with the series and it's methodology it will go over most player's heads (and is still not particularly compelling). Side quests and NPCs are utterly boring. The open world is beautiful at first glance but ultimately feels lifeless and I really didn't have that much fun exploring it. People saying that this is one of the best parts of the game feels nuts to me and makes me question what other open world RPGs they've played (or not full open world RPGs too). AI is actually idiotic most of the time and sneaking is absurdly easy, which is an odd contrast to the difficulty of combat. Menu navigation is absurdly bad. There is no journal. Etc. The whole game lacks any character outside of sheer desolation. If you are into that vibe and the satisfaction of getting through something really hard - great. But that's not the only metric of a game and anyone who criticizes these aspects of the game is immediately scoffed at for not understanding Fromsoft games. I suppose you could rate this as a 10/10 if you what you care about is a game reaching the pinnacle of Fromsoft play design. Otherwise, how can a game be a perfect game when it alienates substantial portions of the people who bought the hype of an open-world RPG worked on by RR Martin and got slapped in the face by this game. I played this game for hours and hours hoping that it would grow on me and that maybe if I could just ""git gud"" it would become more fun. But after all that time- I simply can't justify putting any more into it. When I look back at playing this game I can honestly say it just simply wasn't compelling or fun for me. I'm glad all the FromSoft fans are pleased. That's truly awesome. But I feel like anyone considering a purchase needs to understand what it offers- and the many things it doesn't.",1,2
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is probably the game of the decade for me. If you are looking for a triple A title to hold your hand, look elsewhere. It’s not for everyone. From soft has perfected the sense of adventure and curiosity with such a dense world. It is a challenging game that fills you with adrenaline when you overcome it. There’s a lot of talk about accessibility but out of all the from soft games, this one is the most flexible and easier to follow. If you are having a hard time, explore, level up, get better gear or upgrade, play with friends or strangers. There are tons of options and customizability. Magic feels great, tanking feels great, weaving in and out feels great. And you can respec 1/3rd in the game, if you change your mind on a build. For old fans of the genre, this is like a celebration of everything that was loved about the previous games. 10/10 for me. Easy.",1,2

It's probably the best game I've ever played and I have already over 100 hours.The gameflow, gameplay, combat is perfection. They took the best from all souls games and created a magnum opus in terms of combat.The enemys/bosses and areas are so amazing and detailed that I am still stunned when I look at it.Cinematics are awesome and it has so much good content, that it blew my mind.The quests and story is also wonderful and I was never more into a game as Elden Ring overall. Definetely a 10/10.Now lets talk about the current ""controvery"":Some Game devs (Especially the sore loosers at ubisoft) badmouthed this game with various untrue reasons like: missing UI, bad graphics, overhyped by game critics and so on (,while being unable to make good games theirself).Saddest part is, that some ubi-fanboys are reviewbombing this game and giving their favourite ""open world game"" perfect score. They usually copy ubisofts and over devs words and just add the ""bad performance"" part for PC, which mostly has been fixed for people above min. reqiurements.If you don't like it or even hate the game, I guess it's okay if you give like a 5. But it shouldn't be objectively possible to give below 5 because it's in every aspect amazing. Now to all the Fanboys/Clowns: If you really hate it, it's okay. Taste is objective.If you think the game is bad because of gameplay or graphics then you didn't know what game you bought in the first place and you are a fool.If the game doesn't run smoothly, next time read the System requirements, which they posted like 1 week even before release.If you cry about UI, lore or just copy the stupid/false words from the ""devs"", just go to your corner and play your easy/boring/bad microtransaction games with 800 questmarker/waypoints on the map where you just follow a path like a bot without thinking/playing yourself. If that's the case, you are the reason why gaming gets bad and gives money to those big ""triple A"" companys, who exploit clowns like you.If you want to fight me in an argument about this, just add me on steam or write me a comment there.

Fans of the series will absolutely love it. It's incredibly unique, challenging, and satisfying. The story is intriguing and told similarly to the previous games. While I think review bombing on this game is a little unnecessary, I do understand how newcomers to this series will find this game daunting and asking perhaps a little too much. It's never been for everyone, but in a game that you will at least need to commit 70+ hours to, it can be a tall order.

I've spent 60+ hours traversing the various locations within the game and I am STILL finding things I missed before! With a varied skill tree and no real guard rails, every player is capable of having their own unique experience, exploration and perseverance are rewarded with powerful weapons, spells, armor, side quest progression and new areas to explore. PC players be cautious, the port is not perfect, and due to it's current popularity the servers are overwhelmed. However I find it very hard to criticize this game given the scope and effort put into it.Probably the biggest reason I recommend this game is due to the social aspect surrounding it. You WILL see and do things your friend might miss, and the UI is meant to be communicated amongst players. Multiplayer is it's own unique experience, and the game (like prior titles) allows you to leave helpful messages for future adventurers to read.

Map traversal is more rewarding than ever for exploration and at the same time more simple thanks to statues and graces being so abundant. Not having to run back through whole levels just to get back to a boss is a huge improvement from previous titles. I think they’ve proved you can have a open world game that’s not just the same copied garbage over and over. I’m over a hundred hours in and I still keep finding secrets that I missed and encounters that I wouldn’t expect out in the middle of seemingly nowhere.

"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,So my brother begged me to play this game with him because we were looking for a new co op game to play together. Though I wasn’t a dark souls fan I caved in because he said it was different. So right out the gate your thrown into battle not being told anything. Ok heard it was a little difficult so I’ll have to learn as I play. Which became one of my issues with the game. It tells you nothing just go. I learned later that there was a tutorial at the beginning. Doesn’t make sense to have it but hide it away from players. In that first hour of playing I tired to join up with my brother to play and neither of us could figure it out. As he watched videos on how to do it I explored some more. I was playing as a mage and what became very annoying was when I ran out of mana I’d tried to use a potion and I was left with an animation where he would just scratch his ass then shrug his shoulders then being killed. This would also happen when trying to use a summon in a boss fight. So we finally got the co op to work and as a mage I was now restricted to only 2 potions and no check points to restore them making me a warrior very quickly in the battle. After beating a boss you are kicked out of the game and must remake the item’s which isn’t hard to rejoin. So realizing that this game would take longer to play in co op we played solo instead. After running into box collecting missions it hit me I have no clue what this world is about and how to find what missions I’ve started. I get the whole you’ll find it when you come across it but I’ve forgot which castles or locations they asked me to go to. Then brought me back to the main story in the game. What is it. Why does everyone I talk to hate me then beg me for help. Why hire someone to help write your story but there is none. So I continued on for another few hours and butt scratching moments when I came across so more issues that I really wasn’t playing attention to at the beginning. The controls are bad. You’ll get locked in a animation. Then when they start to attack and your smashing the dodge. Your number one move in game. Being quickly chopped down.  Doesn’t help either when enemies are stuck in the walls or inside chest and can attack you but you can’t hit them. PvP to me is very cheesy and should be for those who wish to play it. After killing a boss and trying to return to a check point I’m interrupted multiple times by another player then losing all my runes. Just to spawn back into game where another player joins game causing me to lose everything I just worked so hard to get. So in end I was left with any butt scratching. I wanted to like this game but couldn’t. Frame rate drops made things more difficult between the multiple rolls and butt scratching I’d go through. Story 1/10 controls 4/10 pve 1/10 pvp 7/10 when wanting to do so. Visually 8/10  sound 9/10.  It feels more like a sandbox rpg then anything else.,1,2
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"The design of this game is just on another level.

"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,"Let's start by saying that I played, replayed, and loved the DS games. Let's also preface this with me admitting that I saw the reviews for the game before playing it and that may have affected my expectations.

Anyway, I wonder if most of the critics played this on console. I played it on PC and it's very far from the near-perfect experience most of them promised.

The controls alone are some of the clunkiest I've seen. G for map, E + an arrow key (and if you're on a 60% keeb, this is really annoying), etc.

There's also the way it almost seems designed to make things difficult for you unnecessarily if you're on a KB+M. Yes, I know the usual advice: play it with a controller instead, and so on.

But if you release something for PC, you should plan for KB+M. You shouldn't expect your players to have to invest in a controller for a single game that has already cost them $60.

It's clear that even after all the critique levelled at them for doing the same thing in DS games, FromSoft still hasn't learned a thing about porting to PC or KB+M play. You'd be astonished how flawless your own gameplay can be only to be interrupted repeatedly by a camera seizing control or the auto-targeting locking onto a mosquito when you're trying to deliver a final blow to a boss.

That's my main gripe, but it's not the only one. There's also the frame-skipping and input lag. I haven't died to any bosses yet, but I'm guessing it's only a matter of time before that instability hits me at a critical moment. And I'm on a 5950x with a 3090.

Yes, I've heard the argument to just treat this as another hurdle or another level of difficulty to make the game more interesting, by the way. But while I don't mind intentional difficulty, I mind sloppy sources of annoyance. I don't play games to be irritated by someone else's oversights or laziness.

Finally, I'm a little let down by parts of the game, I think. I like some things - some things genuinely seem new and add interesting mechanics to the gameplay FromSoft offers. But too many things seem to still be stuck in the DS world. I've seen bosses like these before. I've seen enemies like these before.

Maybe the promise of something new and revolutionary got me expecting too much. But this was neither new nor revolutionary. I'm almost done playing through it, and I'm thinking I won't replay it... which isn't how I want to feel after playing an open-world game.",1,2
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Greatest game in a decade. Elden Ring divers on all fronts, allowing freedom to explore while also sharing a wondrous world with anyone brave enough to explore it.",1,2
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring is the magnum opus from developer From Software and delivers in every facet. BUT, if you are not accustomed to Souls games or have trouble being left alone in a game with no help this game might not be for you. It's a shame though that people are giving this game negative reviews for minute details such as frame rate drops and difficulty but then negating the vast open world, deep combat system, gameplay mechanics, lore, music, art design, and the many other things this game delivers on. I have played every From Software game and can easily say Elden Ring is the hardest, but if you dedicate your time to exploring the world and the treasures it has to offer, you can easily level up enough to make any boss a cake walk. To touch on the exploration aspect of the game if you choose to not explore the world and rush your way through onto the main bosses you are missing the quintessential part of Elden Ring, the discovery and unfolding lore of the Lands Between. While you ride your spectral steed Torrent you'll see vast mountains with castles, forests, dilapidated churches, and if you can see it you can you can explore it. Much of the gameplay is spent through finding places to loot for items that will make your character stronger to inch their way towards becoming the Elden Lord. The bosses are some of From's best ever, many of them in my most difficult bosses in any game. The side characters give you so much information about the world helping paint the broken fragments of the Lands Between. I can say so much more to exemplify why this game truly is a masterpiece, but my biggest compliment is that I have beaten the game 3 times, earned 100% completion, collected every item, and I cant wait to do it all over again.

"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This game is extremely fun! I've never played a dark souls game so I was intimidated by the difficulty of elden ring, but I broke down and bought it and I am glad I did. I got slaughtered by everything at first but with some time roaming the beautiful open world, and upgrading my character I was able to beat some of the bosses with ease.",1,2
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,A genre re-defining game. The amount of care and thought put into this game is ridiculous. Souls veterans will feel right at home while newcomers have the accessibility to jump on in. From world building to design the game is damn near perfect. One of the best games made.,1,2
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"GREATEST open world I've played.There is a lot of content, im talking hours of stuff to do. Really enjoyed!Some same weapons and spells from dark souls series, but if its not broken then don't fix it. Love the ability to customize weapons. This make an endless amount of buildsTo those giving this game a 0 because of difficult bosses, heres sum advice:Git Gud :)",1,2
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Amazing game, a simple Dark Souls game but very entertaining, full of references to other video games, mangas and tv shows, this game simply makes me wanna play forever, the attention to detail is very good, the battle bosses are very entertaining, exiting and skillful, loved this game, has to be a Goty",1,2
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Really love this game. I never played a souls game before and it is as difficult as I heard, unless you over leveled. The open world is amazing. The game doesn't really lead you to anything so some things may require a quick google or YouTube video. All the variety of weapons are super fun. A couple seemed a little OP, but they could be patched at some point. Really no complaints, once you learn you can't go balls out every time and have to play strategically it gets even better. And killing your first boss is super rewarding. So if you don't mind alot of trial and error and very little to no hand holding definitely give this game a go.",1,2

"Mar 15, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,One of that best games I have ever played. Yes I love the games made by FromSoftware.  They have outdone themselves.  The map is amazing and I have been discovering new things around ever corner.  Thank you for this amazing game!,1,2
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Easily the best game I have ever played and I've played a lot. There are no performance problems on PS5. Graphics are amazing. Real souls fans will definitely love this game.,1,2

"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Fantastic open world game. Plenty to do. Typical from soft challenge with plenty to master. Many ways to approach the game depending on play style with the ability to adapt and reset as you progress. Lots to try out building on the soulsborne formula. Graphics are decent but not up to bluepoint standard for dark souls remake.,1,2
"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"The Game is fun, but too hard. I loved the Souls Games, because they were hard but never unfair. Its different here. 2 to 3 hits from the normal enemies, like birds or bats for instance and youre down. The first games were challenging, this is frustrating. Kinda ruined the whole Game for me. Exploring was so much fun though.",1,2
"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Over 100 hours of playable content and great boss design. The open world is attractive and difficulty can be easy to hard depends on whether you want to summon.,1,2
"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"It seems to be some emotional bounce reaction below for the game... feel sad to feel about it. Have been playing many 3A open world games, this is absolutely one of the master pieces and derseve a score at 97 (same level with RDR2, Zelda etc.) The world is stunning and beautiful to explore and maintains a high level of battle mechanism. Good story telling (though lack of necessary guidance but no t a big issue, people are too spoied by the questions marks and quest logs nowadays). I would absolutely give 10 to this one.",1,2
"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring is the fruition of esoteric mystique in lore and visual storytelling and challenging gameplay in a dark fantasy setting. The challenge this time around was implementing an open world and not falling into the trap that so many others fall into; being wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. From has managed to create a landscape so full of content, secrets and genuinely rewarding exploration that it is at times quite overwhelming to completionist players.

What makes this game extra special is that it doesn't lose its identity in branching out to a new approach either- the game stays true to the Souls' original beloved formulae while also daring to go in new directions. During my time with the game there have been so many incredible moments, some even going as far as reminding me of childhood memories, living out my imagination as to what the perfect adventure game could be. It's hard to put into words, but it really is amazing that they were able to fit in as much as they have into a 50gb game. There are rabbit holes everywhere which twist and turn into new landscapes, some of which are hidden within already hidden areas.

50 hours in and I'm still discovering new places to explore. Highly recommended and close to perfection.",1,2
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"The open world is very full, there are side missions everywhere, the boss fights are incredibly enjoyable, they have created a perfect game by blending souls mechanics with such a beautiful open world, everyone should try this game.",1,2
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Great game. People say it's bad and it's too much like dark souls. It's a lot like dark souls just with an open world. Does that make it all of a sudden a game for everyone? Ofc not its still a Souls game. If you don't like souls games you probably won't like this game, but to act like it's objectively a bad game comes off as salty. If you put the time in to learn/grind the game will reward you, if that's not your thing cool but that's always been how these games have worked.",1,2
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,this game is simply a banger. Probably the best game I have ever played. All those haters are so ratio. they absolutely don't understand the value of the best game ever published. definitely a must play.,1,2
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"What a great game. As someone with massive open world fatigue who struggles to enjoy objectively good games like Ghost of Tsushima due to repetitiveness, this game is engaging, and I enjoy every second int eh lands between. Every weapon is viable, every playstyle is viable and the combat is just incredible. The best part is when I beat a boss and lay down my summon sign to help someone else out. Beating Radhan for someone was very therapeutic after taking 15 tries to beat him myself. 100/100",1,2
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Games fantastic. is it an absolutely perfect godsend FromSoftware has bestowed on us from the gods? no, but it is a great game that i personally really enjoy.

Pros
The bosses are tough as hell but it never feels like you can't win
The game is absolutely stunning and there's dozens of spots that are background worthy with how fantastic they look
the world feels pretty lively. some enemies will fight each other, castles are getting invaded, and festivals are going on

Cons
there are platforming sections and the game is absolutely not designed for platforming
many of the enemies can stun lock you to death, especially if you're low poise
those festivals, invasions, and such are going on all the time so while the worlds lively it's also static

I personally feel like my major pros heavily outweigh my major cons and the game so far has been an absolute blast. It's worth a shot even if it isn't for everyone. it'll piss off FromSoftware Diehards because it reuses stuff from the older games and changes up some of the mechanics. It'll also really piss off people who don't want to, or don't have the time to, work hard for a win. Grant it there's plenty of ways to cheese a lot of the bosses. summons, allies, and over leveling, but if you don't have the time to ""get good"" at the game they probably won't have the time to learn each of the spirits either which puts em in a bad situation.

If you like more difficult games, or don't mind using every strategy to get a win, you'll really enjoy this game i think",1,2
"Mar 14, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring is the simultaneous revitalization of the Soulsbourne genre and a masterclass achievement of game design. From Software have not only polished and refined their tried-and-true combat system, but breathed life into its gameplay via the greatest open world I have yet to play. The open world is neither the sole focus of the game nor a tacked-on gimmick: its a tool by which the excellent gameplay can be experienced. At any point, you can choose to delve into the excellently designed dungeons of the Lands Between, or, if they prove too difficult for you just yet, venture into the bountiful yet still dangerous world to level up and unravel the world's mysteries. This is not an ""Easy Mode"" to just cheat away the difficulty of the dungeons with a Level 100 character: it is an option to alleviate and replace the difficulty of reflex driven combat with the critical thinking and adventure that well-designed open-worlds demand.

-Un monde gigantesque tant en terme de surface ou de contenu, un jeu qui arrive à entremêler qualité et quantité est assez rare de nos jours et donc à souligner.
Je me répète : un univers incroyable, une épopée épique et pleine de mélancolie mêlée au gigantisme du royaume (ref à Shadow of Colossus)

-Une exploration intelligente et extrêmement généreuse avec de vrai récompenses à la clé !

-Un gameplay sensiblement identique à celui de Dark Souls 3 mais en plus abouti : des centaines d'armes, sort, miracle, etc... des weapons arts (cendre de guerres) à foison et qui en toute la plupart une vrai utilité lors des affrontements et l'ajout d'un saut mdr, cela peut paraître assez anecdotique mais qui s'intègre parfaitement dans l'exploration et le gameplay roulade/saut

-Une réalisation un peu en dessous des standards actuels mais sublimée par la direction artistique du titre, d'ailleurs celle-ci ne faiblit jamais et je tiens à féliciter FromSoftware pour cela !! On peut donc être un peu surpris par les animations un peu rigides et les graphisme ok tiers en début de partie mais une fois la première heure passée, on est dedans et on ne fait plus attention à ça.

"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"as a big soulsborne fan, and finally finishing the game, i think i can give an honest review.
first of all, it's a great game. it's a souls like game at it's best. and very approachable for new souls like players. it's fair because it begins difficult which will encourage you to explore the world and as a result, you will get stronger and game gets easier. the map is gorgeous, not only it's not empty, but also not flooded with random useless stuff. everything feels very well balanced. specially the dungeons and creatures which will reward you for with crafting materials and cool items. it's truly a solid game. BUT, allow me to give my humble opinion lol.
i don't think it's a masterpiece of a game.
bugs and graphics has no matter to me. it will get fixed. it's childish to argue about that.
art direction is also incredible and i have nothing to argue about.
as always, the game stays loyal to it's own rules and i truly respect that.
but i think my main problem with this game is, while it's really has a beautiful and artistic world design, it's bad at level design.
maybe im biased. i don't know, you judge. i have played everything fromsoftware has offered and i believe they all are masterpieces. and i understand elden ring was a huge project. but it's still not an evolutionary game, in my opinion of course.
but the levels are not handcrafted. it doesn't feel the same quality as the quantity is so large.
also i feel like for such a large game, there are not enough memorable and bold boss fights, armaments, armor sets and etc. ( i may be so wrong at this part but at least it felt this way at the moment im writing this).

in the end i want to say, i am not disappointed. but this game won't be in my heart in a few years, while all soulsborne games are eternally attached to my heart and soul.
elden ring is a beautiful game with many lost opportunities. specially for it's multiplayer.
think about it.  for a game with such a large map. it could have pvp arenas, incredible covenants,
hell, there could be a palace for each covenant. areas for getting invaded by certain covenants, etc.

again, i totally understand the weight of this project on from software, and i appreciate and respect it none the less. but.. yeah. 96? i don't know.. let's wait and see how the game will be treated after a few months or even a year.",1,2
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,I haven’t been as addicted to a games since DS2. Sunk around 70 hours into this game already! Looks amazing and there is so much variety of play-styles and progression routes!,1,2
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Yes this is the one of a few games that i give a 10/10 score, I never been a Dark soul or Demon soul fan, not because of the difficulty (I love challenging game and I'm a big fan of Sekiro) but because how slow the movement is, and no jump!!!, it just not my cup of tea. I love Sekiro, challenging, awesome combat system, awesome bosses (so sad that there is no dlc for it) so when Elden ring came, I was really considering should I order it or not, and in the end I gave a try.

So? it is awesome, every complaints about Dark soul now is gone in Elden ring, the movement feel so smooth and you can jump (awesome). The world is beautiful, the graphic to be honest not at next level, but it is still beautiful, every lands, dungeons and runes are unique, the combat system is great, still I miss the posture and parry mechanic from Sekiro ( you can still parry if you get the right shield or weapon). Elden ring open world is one of the best period imo, you can explore every placer before the story route, even some of the area at the end game can be even explored very early, so it is also a very forgiving soul like game compare to previous From soft games.

It's been a while since I was so into a game like this, spent around 60 hrs already, and this is easily GOTY for me, I downloaded this together with Horizon forbidden west in PS5 and after playing Elden ring, i feel Horizon is a bit boring now even I love Zero dawn (sorry Horizon fan).

It has some optimization issue for pc but after some update now it is much better. After playing this game, I'm a big fan of From soft now can't wait for them to release some DLC for it.",1,2

as always, the game stays loyal to it's own rules and i truly respect that.
but i think my main problem with this game is, while it's really has a beautiful and artistic world design, it's bad at level design.
maybe im biased. i don't know, you judge. i have played everything fromsoftware has offered and i believe they all are masterpieces. and i understand elden ring was a huge project. but it's still not an evolutionary game, in my opinion of course.
but the levels are not handcrafted. it doesn't feel the same quality as the quantity is so large.
also i feel like for such a large game, there are not enough memorable and bold boss fights, armaments, armor sets and etc. ( i may be so wrong at this part but at least it felt this way at the moment im writing this).

in the end i want to say, i am not disappointed. but this game won't be in my heart in a few years, while all soulsborne games are eternally attached to my heart and soul.
elden ring is a beautiful game with many lost opportunities. specially for it's multiplayer.
think about it.  for a game with such a large map. it could have pvp arenas, incredible covenants,
hell, there could be a palace for each covenant. areas for getting invaded by certain covenants, etc.

again, i totally understand the weight of this project on from software, and i appreciate and respect it none the less. but.. yeah. 96? i don't know.. let's wait and see how the game will be treated after a few months or even a year.",1,2
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,I haven’t been as addicted to a games since DS2. Sunk around 70 hours into this game already! Looks amazing and there is so much variety of play-styles and progression routes!,1,2
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Yes this is the one of a few games that i give a 10/10 score, I never been a Dark soul or Demon soul fan, not because of the difficulty (I love challenging game and I'm a big fan of Sekiro) but because how slow the movement is, and no jump!!!, it just not my cup of tea. I love Sekiro, challenging, awesome combat system, awesome bosses (so sad that there is no dlc for it) so when Elden ring came, I was really considering should I order it or not, and in the end I gave a try.

So? it is awesome, every complaints about Dark soul now is gone in Elden ring, the movement feel so smooth and you can jump (awesome). The world is beautiful, the graphic to be honest not at next level, but it is still beautiful, every lands, dungeons and runes are unique, the combat system is great, still I miss the posture and parry mechanic from Sekiro ( you can still parry if you get the right shield or weapon). Elden ring open world is one of the best period imo, you can explore every placer before the story route, even some of the area at the end game can be even explored very early, so it is also a very forgiving soul like game compare to previous From soft games.

It's been a while since I was so into a game like this, spent around 60 hrs already, and this is easily GOTY for me, I downloaded this together with Horizon forbidden west in PS5 and after playing Elden ring, i feel Horizon is a bit boring now even I love Zero dawn (sorry Horizon fan).

It has some optimization issue for pc but after some update now it is much better. After playing this game, I'm a big fan of From soft now can't wait for them to release some DLC for it.",1,2

The open world works incredibly well and the game never loses that which makes a souls game great. Elden ring can be extremely difficult but so rewarding. And if you get frustrated it's easy to go do something else. Controls feel like dark souls 3 and that's a good thing in my opinion.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Alright I making this review because it feels like this game is getting review bombed. I’ve been scrolling down the reviews and have seen plenty of 1 and 2 scores siting “bad graphics” “old gameplay” and “poor optimization”. Now while graphics are nothing special in the game, the art style if fantastic. There have been scenes in the game that actually made me use the capture button for the first time in a single player game. (And I’ve played red dead) besides, since when have graphics or old animation been good enough grounds to give a game a 1.Now couple that with optimization problems and ok, you have a point… if there were actually any major issues. This is the ps5 version of the game, not the pc version. I’ve seen the pc version, and while not unplayable, it certainly could be better. But on ps5, the game runs phenomenal. I haven’t had a single frame drop or stutter at any point in roughly 15 hours, granted I am only at the beginning. But if it stays even remotely as consistent as it has into the late game, then I really don’t see any reason to complain. There has been pop in in the distance, but nothing that I could really say ruins the game. And finally, for the bad/dated gameplay…Git gud.Seriously though, this is a from soft game. You knew what you were getting into. If you have a problem with bosses being able to kill you in 2 hits, that’s fine. but please, stop giving these games a 1 because you can’t beat margit the fell. This is a hard game, we all know this, but it’s also the kind of game that if you continue trying, continue fighting, you will eventually persevere. That’s why we all play these games, and especially with Elden ring, you don’t even have to slam your head against the same boss over and over. If one fight is giving you trouble, go off the other way and fight something else. You aren’t limited on your options anymore, and that’s what makes this game stand out from the previous souls games. Yes, it plays like dark souls but open world. But did it really have to be anything else? The world design is like Zelda botw, but with far less empty space. And the combat is similar to ds3, but still different enough to stand on its own. And even if it was identical to ds3… that’s still dark souls 3 combat. That’s not a bad combat system to follow. Just please stop giving it a 1 because it’s not sekiro. Well in summary cause I know y’all just skipped straight to the end, this game really doesn’t deserve all the 1s it’s getting. And I just ask y’all giving it such low ratings to rate the game for what it is, not what you wanted it to be. It’s not sekiro, and it’s not a graphics tech demo, but it is a masterpiece.",10,21
"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Fully reviewing this now after many, many hours, and all I can say is... I heartily regret not being able to give it a 10. It should be a 10, on so many levels, but I can only score it a 9.

Why? Well, may as well get the only negative out of the way first - the performance is ropey. I've seen people defend it, and seen some pretending it doesn't even exist, but the brutal honest truth is that the pop in on display here is staggeringly bad and takes you out the game on a consistent basis, and the frame rate is also patchy - not as bad, not enough to make the game unplayable (at least on performance mode) but it is certainly a factor.

That's the only negative. In every other respect - gameplay, world building, level design, controls, writing, literally everything - Elden Ring is an absolute masterpiece. It is, without doubt, the best open world game I've ever played, bar none. Breath of the Wild, Skyrim etc. etc. don't have a patch on it - this is a staggering achievement from the developer. I lost count of the amount of times my jaw hit the floor playing this thing, how I was constantly surprised, intrigued, thoroughly lost in its' world.

It's not graphical fidelity that draws you in. Elden Ring looks wonderful, but it's because of art design. There are so many games that have wondrous ray-tracing, all the bells and whistles and yet don't look a tenth as good as this thing because it has no visual pop to it. Compare this to, say, Death Stranding - miles upon miles of photorealistic dreariness - and it's chalk and cheese. So many games have combat that is challenging through sheer cheese, or gear gating etc. Elden Ring does it by simply having outstanding combat design. This is a game you could beat without taking a hit, and speedrunners will be doing so before long, because it is brutally difficult yet completely fair. You can count the games that achieve that on one hand, yet Elden Ring makes it look simple.

I'm gushing about it here, but I'm not a From Software fanboy, at all. Dark Souls II is one of my most hated games ever. I scored DS3 an 8/10. None of their previous titles break my top 20 of all time, with Bloodborne coming closest. Before now. Elden Ring breaks my personal top five, because it has taken everything good in their prior games, discarded the bad, and polished it all into a package so ludicrously good that it's actually difficult to imagine how this can be bettered.

It earns the term 'masterpiece'. Astonishing.

------

(The below was my review in progress.)

I'm writing this as a review in progress and will revisit the score if needed - I'm doing it now to counteract the ridiculous reviews from people who I'm 99% sure haven't even beaten Margit, the first boss yet. This is a massive game and needs more than a day or so to review, from anyone.

So yes, first impressions - a flawed masterpiece. There are technical issues - the frame rate, even in performance mode, is occasionally janky, and the game is basically unplayable in 30fps quality mode. There is a fair bit of pop in too, and graphical fidelity isn't the best, but the art style is absolutely phenomenal, and that's more important.

For the most part, on PS5 the frame rate holds up, and when it does the controls are tight, responsive and the difficulty as such is completely fair. The world itself is astonishingly well done, beautifully crafted with clever enemy placement and always something new to find round every corner.

I'll come back in a week or two and review properly, but those scoring below 7 or 8 are well off the mark; even early on you can tell this is a top tier title, and the only real criticisms of it are a lack of accessibility due to difficulty (but not every game has to be for everyone; the developer should be free to make the game they want to make and not have to compromise authenticity) and technical hiccups.",9,19
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"The name Elden Ring in itself is misleading. It's Elden Ring in name only. Should have just been called Dark Souls 4 instead as its the same tried and tried Dark Souls gameplay with the addition of an open world map and a horse. Enemy, dungeon variety and some backgrounds resembling paintings are some of the only unique redeeming features in an otherwise totally mediocre package with a boring empty world to navigate, no interesting navigation in the world outside of horse mounts, washed out last-gen visuals with a bleak depressing setting as well as numerous performance issues that are evident throughout. After giving this game a second chance, I just cannot see how this game possibly deserved all time high scores from reviewers. Maybe down the line with some additional DLC the game might improve further, but right now, I cannot recommend this game to anyone other than dedicated Souls fans. This has to go down as one of the most shameful chapters in game review history (with reviewers bias blatantly turning a blind eye to the games issues) with Elden Ring becoming one of the most overrated games of all time. There are far better open world games worth your time over this one.",9,19

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"The game is good but not to the extent the reviews have shown it to be.

The Game starts great but gets dragged on after say 15-20 hours . Many of the bosses are repetitive &amp; recycled (esp. later in the game) &amp; are cheap in the sense that they are quite easy. A fun gameplay is the one where you have to work out to come against challenges but here if you are just a bit smart enough you will be moving like an OP player most of the time taking away all the fun of the game itself. It has a tedium quest system i.e. you need to explore open world to defeat story bosses . This is a very old structure &amp; many a times it has been been criticized &amp; condemned as poor game structure but none of the reviewers is pointing it here ..why because its a souls game.

The game is saved by its art direction, it is praise-worthy otherwise the Graphics are poor, many parts it is generic &amp; shows no work is done on the graphical department just used the Graphic editor output as it is, overall quite poor it is in parts. NPCs &amp; story is actually forgotten .
We are still not over with it. The Icing on the cake is the performance , it not only stutters at 4K but also at 1080p(on a 2080ti), Damn what these reviewers are doing ?? that being not pointed out by reviewers is just bad, totally bad ..Are they paid?? It just lacks polishing compared to other titles. What’s bad and lazy in the game is just plain bad and lazy. I believe that developers got this advantage that it is a souls game so even small or big things like camera issues etc are planned in the game intentionally .

Overall the game is quite overhyped with all those giving it a 10 have never played a good open world before or either new to gaming or have just gone with the trend of high rating it. Be careful.
Its a game which one should try out after the game is around or below 20$ . Its nothing close to Bloodborne or Sekiro. Gave it a 6/10 because of its performance issues otherwise its a solid 8/10 .

Graphics - 2.5/5   Art Direction - 4.5/5
Story/NPCs - 2/5 Gameplay - 4/5 (not counting the recycled &amp; repetitive stuff)
Discovery &amp; Adventure feel - 3.5/5(your mileage will vary)
Sound - 4/5   Music - 3/5
Open-World - 3.5/5",8,17
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,4,"I'm not sure why this game gets such perfect scores from review sites, but since you can read the positives everywhere on the internet even when you're not trying to, let me detail some of the negatives about what is effectively Dark Souls in a brighter environment.

You can't pause. Let's say you have an actual life, like your doorbell rings or your child starts screaming or anything else that interrupts you - no pausing, even if you're offline and playing solo. It's 2022 and we're going to give a 10/10 to a game that you can't pause when you're playing solo? Absurd.

The graphics aren't great. They're good, but not great. Certainly an upgrade, but nothing exceptional. And the entire UI looks like it's still the original Dark Souls garbage. They even seem to be using a ton of the same sounds. It's like they reused as many assets as possible to avoid having to actually create something new when creating a new game.

I appreciate more tutorial-like encounters to help ease you into the world, but the tutorial section is optional and ""hidden"" behind an obtuse message that should have just ended with ""go here for a tutorial"". Basically adding the ability to be more user-friendly without explicitly being more user-friendly.

I was expecting way better from the story given the involvement of George RR Martin, but no, it's just as **** and mostly non-existent as any other Dark Souls game. And the writing of the dialog is super cringe most of the time.

For context, Witcher 3, which is vastly superior to this game in almost every aspect, received a lower overall score with fewer perfect scores in all. Yet Witcher 3 is more suitable to a multitude of play types and difficulty levels, still has better graphics than this game does despite a 7-year release gap, great dialog and voice acting (overall), an amazing story with wonderful side quests, and you can pause the game if you need to.

The only reason I can imagine for this game getting so much critical acclaim is because there's some weird hard-on that the gaming community at large has for Dark Souls. It skews opinions and even rejects common sense at times, in favor of worshipping Dark Souls despite everything that is obviously dated and ill-fitting to a modern gaming experience from a big-name studio that should definitely have the budget and expertise to produce better.",8,17

The PS5 version, even on Performance mode, cannot hit 60 fps or stably run the game without massive frame drops. I guess Fromsoftware extended their cryptic methods usually used for storytelling to how to purchase and play the game.

-No new ideas. Exchange runes for souls, the maiden for firelink shrine maiden, tarnished for hollowed, etc. It's the lore of Dark Souls with new names. George RR Martin had little to no impact on the story.
-Ugly graphics, especially compared to Demon's Souls Remake. Elden Ring looks like a PS2 game by comparison
-Copy-paste combat from Dark Souls 3; just dodge, hit, and dodge.
-Boring setting. How many games in general and in the Soulsborne series are going to be set in Medieval Western Europe? Choose a new setting like Sekiro or Bloodborne.
-Open-world. Meaning you run across empty fields for 10 minutes to get to an actual fun part of the game.
-Copy-paste enemies. The Black Knights from Dark Souls 1 are back, as well as the Crabs from 3. I haven't seen an original enemy yet.

Every version of this game (PS5, PC, etc) is technically broken with invisible enemies, freezes, FPS drops, stuttering where you teleport from one area to another, crashes to white screen, and more. Even without these grips, there is nothing new or exciting here.

There are serious problem with the camera control during combat or maybe I am just not used to it. Tested confessor then astrologist class both very challenging for beginner.

This game, through ALL fault of it's own, marketed itself to people who love open world RPG's but just couldn't fall in love with DS because of it's difficulty, repetitiveness and questionable mechanics. They knew that if they threw out George RR Martin's name, promoted ""open world"" and talked about how this game is a departure from the Souls series for a variety of different reasons, that they would gain a MASSIVE amount of new players. Do you think FromSoftware isn't aware that the majority of people purchase games digitally (AKA not able to be returned) these days? It was a total win win for them. The worst thing that happens is they sell a ridiculous amount of copies, recruit players who were on the fence about Souls games (doesn't matter if they don't like it after the fact), and retain their loyal player base who love DS so that there are enough good reviews to keep up a positive image.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Quite possibly the best video game ever created.

It majestic....a hybrid sandbox of high fantasy and horror.

I originally played DS3 after my roommate forced me to play. He would knock on my door every day and ask me to play but I had heard ""souls games hard."" Eventually I played and one late night alone in the irithyll dungeon the game clicked and made sense. Ever since then I have played every one...DS1/2/BB/Sekiro.

Elden Ring is a stunning combination of all of those games put into one.

It takes heavy influence from games like Shadow of the Colossus &amp; Breath of The Wild.

The atmosphere &amp; mood is the defining factor here. You will feel lost, overwhelmed, frustrated and triumphant all at once. The game is asking you to get lost and through that feeling you find yourself.

Even with all of my prior experience the game still scares me. I move cautiously &amp; take calculated risks. Although sometimes I end up in areas where I cant turn back and I have to reach inside of myself for something more....I have to overcome myself &amp; become more in that moment.

Its hard to explain this feeling or to quantify it but it is the exact experience that Souls fans love and why the games are so adored. No other piece of media or games ask this of you. They hold your hand...Souls games leave you stranded on the side of the road and say ""good luck""

I read some reviews prior to this and they are complaining about graphics....about design...about frame rate....all of them are meaningless if you manage to let the game take you and unfold itself before you.",4,9

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"I love the Souls games. I do not love this. Despite the claims that this is somehow more accessible or easier, it's clearly not the case. I've put in 10 hours and I've managed to get past the first boss. There are new mechanics that are unexplained and the open world makes it ten times harder to find NPC merchants. I started as an Astrologer and the only magic vendor I found for the first 9 hours was a guy who sold three spells, two of which I already had! (I found another guy who also sold a whopping three spells but as I was constantly dying, I didn't have the paltry number of runes to buy any of them.)

Drops are basically nonexistent. Whereas in previous Souls games, you'd find weapons and armor that you could try out, I found maybe three new weapons in my exploration. And good luck with upgrade materials. I had to look up where to get them because I had only gotten my weapon up to +1. Turns out I missed a cave (I went all around it but didn't find the cave itself) that had some materials in it. Instead you can forage endless piles of crap for crafting stuff that you'll never use (and you need to buy dozens of cookbooks to make different things). I hate crafting, it's never fun, it's just a way to drag out a game.

And then there's combat. I don't know what they want you to do, honestly. The first enemies you'll find are pushovers, then you'll run across a plethora of various knights who have seemingly infinite poise and stamina, so they will bum rush you and annihilate you before you can even hit them. The one mandatory boss I beat is so relentless and has so many combos that I barely beat him with a +5 sword, my vitality upgraded to 20, and two people summoned to help. It's a boss I would expect to see in a DLC area, not the first one in the game. They also seem to have taken Bloodborne's ""throw as many enemies on the map as possible"" and doubled it. Some places just have endless numbers of copy-pasted enemies.

Finally, the world design is less than inspired. A lot of areas are just ""oh yeah, that's like Boletarian Palace"" or ""look, it's like Stonefang Tunnels"" or ""yay, another poison swamp"". And a lot of the game is so dark that you have to have a torch out otherwise you can't see anything. I was really hoping this game would live up to the hype, but it's just been a big disappointment.",4,9

Even if they try, these Hypocrites still sht on them and praise this unfinished trash (Elden Ring) as next generation of open world games.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"This game is simply awful and anyone who enjoys it must overlook (or ignore) serious flaws.

You will experience on average 20 frame drops just by simply moving around, let alone when in combat. As far as “Souls” games go, what makes them difficult isn’t their enemies, it’s the clunky and jank movement of the character, its painfully slow animations and movements, and the fact that it fails to register button controls correctly or precisely. Trying to play this game after playing Horizon Forbidden West, I simply cannot believe anyone would prefer this game in any way, shape or form. Horizon is a modern game with modern graphics, physics, character models, movement, UI, and fluidity. Elden Ring is just another Souls game, released in 2022 and feels like it’s from 2008. Another souls game reskinned, that is uninteresting and built solely on the cliché of “it’s hard bro and you’ll learn to love it” fan base that doesn’t play any modern games or have seen the outside of their mother's basement since the mid-2000’s.",6,14

And when I say opens up, I mean that, just by exploring a little bit, I ended up in what looks like a different universe.  There is so much to this game.  The story is weak, but I feel that exploration is the key.  You should be able to wander just about anywhere at any time and feel like you have a shot.  If not, mark it and come back later.  You are not guided whatsoever by a linear story, so if you're looking for a story driven game, look elsewhere.  And if you're looking for next-gen or even current-gen graphics, you're not going to find it here.  By why should that be a detriment?  Some game choose to 8-bit their games.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,"Massively overrated game.

Elden rings feels like its built from 80s simple game design with 90s 3d game controls. It’s more a hack and slash game and not much of an RPG.

Soldiers and monsters fight along side against one common enemy – you. The AI is less than what found in the first Zelda game made in the 80s. Monsters and soldiers run in mindless circles and feel misplaced on the map. You can kill a soldier in clear sight in front of another soldier and they won’t mind.

Controls are simple and close to what you expect from the first 3d console games of the 90s. This game is also difficult for the wrong reasons. When you fight monsters, you get runes (money) that may be used to buy stuff from static NPCs scattered around the world. You also use money to buy level ups. If you die after a big boss fight and earn a lot of XP (or money), you loose all the money. This logic makes no sense and makes leveling up difficult unless you stick to grinding easy monsters.

Leveling up is also very tedious as leveling gets you one stat, and one stats makes up for 1-2% more damage or HP. So if you want to balance out the difficulty, you are likely to play hundreds of hours of grinding, and also likely to hit the max stat before it even makes the game easier.

Graphics won’t blow you away but feels OK. Nothing though feels polished. The world feels empty and sterile compared to Witcher. There are no towns and cities with people, and NPCs are placed around with lack of backstory. All in all this feels like a sandbox template with very little effort put into it.

I also don’t know what role George R R Martin took in the storytelling as there is hardly any story to it.

If you don’t like Dark Souls, this is not the game for you. In fact, it’s one of the worst games I’ve ever played. Why this game gets 10/10 from most critics is beyond me and can only be concluded in one of two cases. Paid review, or the critic is a massive Dark Soul fan.

The only good thing I could think is that the Launch edition came with a few stickers and patches, and it’s nice to see they put some effort into that. The sad part is that this game tells other developers that you can get away with a good score just by releasing a standard sandbox template with nothing in it.",3,7

"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,"If we look at broad range of video games, for example 1990 till 2022, Elden Ring achieves absolutely nothing new. One could only call it revolutionary if 1, you only play Souls games 2. Haven't played open world games before 3. You are blindfolded fanboy, who defends this game no matter what.

These kinds of unique/cool looking huge bosses were already in Resident Evil 4 and were done better. Let me remind you, this was 2005. Dead Space did similar thing with bosses, this was 2008. But what these games also had was story, depth, meaningful characters - Elden Ring has hardly any of that. Sure they were not open world, but in Elden Ring people clearly don't care about that ""open world"" anyway, they just run from one boss to another, that's the whole game. So in my opinion this comparison is fair.

If we talk about open world games that have lots of huge monsters/bosses then Skyrim is amazing example for that, but that was 2011. And that game also had quest log, story and up to date graphics.

So let me ask again, what is exactly so revolutionary and new in Elden Ring? What is this phenomenal new thing that this game supposedly archives? There's none of that. Taking away quest log, so you wont remember half the quests you did, is revolutionary?

It's truly, truly sad to see that some people are actually trying to hype this game up and pretend like it's greatest thing ever, while very clearly these people have never even heard of games i just mentioned. I mean, if you love this game, good for you, play it forever i guess. All i wish for is just that there would be also normal games left for gamers who actually like to have fun and not die for one boss 200 times, just so you could figure out their move set, beat them and then move to next boss and repeat same thing 1000 times.

Enemy behaviors are very dynamic. They would do a lot of actions based on the player's actions, which provide both opportunity and risk.

"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,2,"After listening to all the hype about Elden Ring, the legendary G.R.R.Martin was involved in the story and this game is likely to be the best RPG open world game ever, I thought I would give Elden Ring a go. I booted up the game and was instantly impressed with the character creation so was excited to get stuck in.

Now, I have never played a FromSoftware game and I am aware that their games are very hard so I kept that in mind when I died the first few times and accepted my fate. However after hours upon hours of dying, my excitement soon faded. I was getting pretty sick of getting instantly destroyed and was not enjoying myself at all. I decided to read some guides and endless 'GiT gUd ScRuB' comments for some guidance. Souls veterans were saying that the enjoyment comes from finally defeating a tough enemy that has previously been killing you with ease. Yet when I finally managed to defeat the challenging foe, I felt more annoyed with myself that I hadn't killed it sooner and was angry that I had let a game annoy me so much. As I moved on following my victory, I was then able to relive this ordeal and experience the same emotions when I fought my next, harder, nemesis. This revolving door of death, death, small victory and death plunged me in state of anxiety and stress which made me feel legitimately nervous whilst playing this game, eagerly awaiting any enjoyment.

To add to the stress are the other game mechanics. There is no quest log so I struggled to keep track of what I was doing, who I have spoken to or where I was meant to be going. Some souls veterans advise new players to use a diary/notebook when playing a FromSoftware game to keep track of quests... Something that could be achieved by having a quest log built into the game. Secondly, the controls often feel pretty sluggish/janky. For example in the heat of (losing yet another) battle, when trying to change my weapon from one-handed to two-handed to deal more damage or mount my steed to make a hasty getaway only to accidentally use some useless item in my pouch has proved to be fatal several times. Also in the same frantic panic, I tried to pause the game to get a bit of respite and check my inventory. As I tried to navigate to complicated pause menu, I quickly learned to my horror that this game does not pause and continues to run which inevitably proved to be fatal. When I finally managed to traverse through the poorly constructed inventory and equipment menu, I found my summons which I had unlocked earlier. I slotted them into my pouch and ventured forth, only to find out that the summons get to pick and chose when and where they can be summoned, which of course, also proved to be fatal.. yet again.

Visually, despite being far from 60fps on the PS5, Elden Ring still looks really nice in places and discovering new areas can be exciting. However this excitement was soon replaced by the familiar anxiety and stress of being permanently close to death. Trying to take in a new view was often cut short by a new type of enemy one-shotting me from a mile away or some giant using me for a soft landing.

I truly was excited to play this game as it has been hyped and marketed as the best RPG ever. The customisation of your character is brilliant and (although feeling empty and devoid of non-hostile NPCs/towns/markets etc) the open world does feels very explorable. BUT as I've mentioned a few times, the difficulty ruins this game for regular RPG players who are not familiar with or fans of Souls-Borne games. Personally, my free time has become limited due to life taking it's course and I play games to enjoy what spare time I have left. I do not find being held hostage in a constant state of anxiety, stress and annoyance until I pay the ransom of endless trial and error an enjoyable experience. Because of this I have since returned my copy of Elden Ring so I can spend my refunded money on something that will not waste my time.",5,12

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"No spoiler; review by an IT veteran, who has been playing hardcore RPGs since the eighties (pretty much all we had ‘back then’).

Important: I am NOT a fan of the ‘SoulsBorne’ style games.

When Demon Souls was the PS5 launch title to ‘endure’, I put A LOT of time into that game.
and ‘I loved it!’.
We could argue some notion of ‘stockholm syndrome’, but this wasn’t the case…
The game showed that the project had been a labour of love, with design elements that had been clearly thought about for a ‘very long time’. Everything from level layout to world interaction and ‘gradual introduction’ of certain mechanics and gameplay aspects; this was, quite simply, RPG gaming perfection.
Truly it was the best action “D&amp;D” game ever built (and yes, I played Dark Horizon on consoles etc)..
The amount of times I wanted to get my players handbooks down from the shelf (and actually did!) to check certain ‘rules’, this game had VERY DEEP RPG mechanics and didn’t spell ANY OF THEM out to the players.
Demon Souls was a game that rewarded learning the world, learning the lore, and learning the underlying game play mechanics. (like just about no other RPG has made us do, sans one title in the nineties by Microprose, or a modern ‘built for the masses’ RPG like Divinity:OS.. which isn’t an ‘arcade’ fun factor game.. ).

If Demon Souls was the perfect ‘action’ version of an RPG, like in ways that Dungeon Master (1980s) had over Might and Magic (turn based), when this genre started to benefit from the ‘power of computing’; Demon Souls took it to the next level.
The lack of ‘hand holding’ was what many gamers probably craved, and few titles would risk their huge investment to deliver to a ‘niche’ market.
My only gripe with Demon Souls was ‘one of love’; quite simply - I prefer open world games (when done right).. Now, from a story telling perspective, a linear game has clear advantages, and generally proves a ‘tighter experience for that’, but Demon Souls could only have been improved with potentially ‘more interaction’ (NPCs) and a freedom to just ‘live the world’.

So, what happens when the designer of Demon Souls gets to build an open world variant?
Gaming perfection! (for a niche group!!)

Just like Returnal was the perfect Rogue game (done with a big budget, and pushing ‘cutting edge hardware’), Elden Ring is the perfect HARDCORE RPG game.

Except it isn’t perfect:
As someone who has been a professional playtester, who understands IT hardware and software intimately, and who optimises everything to within an inch of its’ life; Elden Ring is lacking what some might demand from a console title (locked framerate, and perfect frametime).
Note I am playing this game from day one, and at the time of writing this there are a ‘few updates’ and ‘more inbound’ (with some niggles acknowledged by the team and the end users)..
They did make some odd choices, like using the early z-cull nature of the PS5 customised video chip (that would naturally smash the Xbox platform for an open world title with vegetation in terms of framerates), and they opted to run the game at higher resolution than the competitor platform, likely so as to not get the ire of the Xbox crowd trying to hold on to the notion that their uncustomised (standard PC architecture parts) should somehow be a theoretical ‘improved performance’. (this just isn’t so, and is hard to pull off even for first party studios, even focusing on ‘just one platform’ -unless intentionally GIMPing (Get In Mediocre Performance) software by making design choices that will play poorly on the other companies hardware (we are seeing this a fair bit, and will see it a lot more in the future!!)); so the designers just upped the resolution so as to not have the ‘lesser system’ delivering vastly better framerates ALL THE TIME. (later patches will no doubt deliver a much better balance, and possibly ray tracing and a smooth 30 fps experience).
We know the game can do smooth 60fps (ps4 pro version of the code on the PS5)
So presently I will not hold back the score of a niche RPG due to performance niggles with an OPEN WORLD RPG.

Yes; Forza and Horizon Forbidden West both run ‘better’ (neophytes can argue); but the reality is those games are built by first party studios, knowing the capabilities of the hardware intimately, and have squeezed ‘suspension of disbelief’ to pefection. HZD uses 6 time of day cycles to save CPU render budget, vs the realtime lighting in this game..
Destructable objects are heavy hitters and is why killzone Mercenary on a 5 watt PSita looks ‘like’ battlefield on a high end PC. (easier to do, suspends disbelief)

This game pushes (niche/hardcore) RPGs forward and is a high watermark for gameplay and immersive world ‘fun’",4,10

"Mar 15, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"I'm a bit ambivalent about how I feel about Elden Ring. A part of me really enjoyed playing this, and playing through a Souls like game again, except in an open world format; however, another part of me thinks this is the worst Souls game ever created.

The bosses are cheap, the open world is lacking, and the story feels like there is bound to be a sequel or DLC coming for it. The bosses cheap comes from the fact that the boss' don't really have an AI, it's more so a tracking bot (in the sense of if and else statements), where literally the enemy knows where you are and specifically turns during an animation to smack you. Most of the open world is meaningless. Like there is a lot to do, and see, but most of the items will not fit with your build unless you force it, and even then, it won't help with a boss fight. Finally, the game has balance issues; like severe balance issues. There are multiple bosses where if you grind it out and get runes you can easily murder them, but then there are other bosses who do one-hit ko's no matter what. There are also some bosses who look like leftovers from other Fromsoft games...

My highlights for this game was the world building. The game looks great, and has an excellent soundtrack. The art really matches the set-pieces and don't look out of place, and in general, I'm glad GRRM participated in this because you can feel that vibe there.

Personally, i think if Fromsoft releases another Elden Ring/ Souls game, I'll be skipping it. I think From doesn't really know what it wants to be anymore, it tries to hard to cater to the generic fans and then the hardcore ones as well, and well, this game is amalgamation of both and a bit too much of it. I enjoyed this game, but it's not really anything innovative, and most times it's more frustrating than fun - so I ask you, do you play games to have fun or be frustrated?",2,5

Everyone who loved soulsborne will find the culmination of fromsofts experience in their hand. Beautiful and interesting areas, frightening enemy designs and challenging but fair boss fights.

But the huge open world design doesnt come without some flaws: Sometimes it is very slow, you really have to commit to exploring, taking your time and be amazed by many hidden areas/dungeons/bosses and loot.
Also i got lost a few times, and the game did not gave me very useful orientation where to go to progress in the main quest. And the last problem for me is that for my taste some enemies/bosses got recycles a bit too often. Performance on PS5 is disappointing, 60 fps should be no problem but is rarely the case.

I have to say I'm a little disappointed. It is Dark Souls 4 in all but name. The 'open world' hype seems unwarranted. Yes the world is large but fundamentally it is no more open than worlds in the other souls games.

The performance issues widely reported - well, I can confirm those. It seems crazy that this game would slow down on a PS5 when games like Returnal, Ghost of Tsushima, and even the Demon Souls remake(!) run flawlessly with superior graphics. Why would they not invest in making this game as slick as possible?

The style of the world and the combat is identical to previous souls games. I mean identical. They've added the ability to jump and crouch, but those are exactly as you would expect them to be. The amount of innovation here is overstated.

Overall I'm still going to play it, but I'm not gripped by it as I have been by previous souls games. I definitely felt a bit let down by just how identical it is to Dark Souls. Bloodborne and Sekiro were phenomenal games that broke the mould and moved away from the tried and tested souls mechanics - but Elden Ring simply picks up where DS3 left off.

The crystal cave part with the centipede guys just spam the needles and can also attack at the same time. Also Raya Lucaria academy is lame. All the enemies will spam spells at you making it not fun after a while. Also it is not clear where to go and I ended up spending a long time to find and item instead of progress. No but really its a good game 10/10 except im not going to give it that score.,2,5

If you play the game like a normal Dark Souls game where you follow a linear path, you'll end having the worst time of your life with this game. There are certain dungeons that I have skipped entirely because of the frustration they cause even after levelling up (mostly due to other than combat-related mechanics), and the rewards you get from finishing dungeons in general often end up being very disappointing, but I would still say that it's a worthy addition to the Soulslike genre.

I don’t know how much from software pay for these ”critic” reviews. I don't mind playing difficult games, but with this one difficulty dosen't come with difficult enemies or level design.

Traversal is annoying, fall deaths from exploring are tedious, the sheer amount of things trying to kill you at all times when you just want to explore, and your inability to fast travel or even look at the map when enemies are around you (basically always).

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"I have never played any of the Souls games before, but being a connoisseur of RPGs and hearing of this supposedly legendary RPG series I felt it was time I finally bit the bullet. I figured with Martin penning the game's story it would be rather grand involving political intrigue and riveting tales of man's inner folly. Having grown up on D&amp;D and CRPGs I expected to have a fair idea of what I was getting into.

Much to my surprise, I found a vast open world filled with nothing to do. I created my character to wander around some lifeless void. Oh, it looks rather grand the art direction is quite phenomenal though the textures muddied and the game is plagued with pop-ins as well. I am able to forgive the occasional jank for a good and true RPG. I however did not find one in this game. I'm not sure what constitutes for an RPG these days amongst the general public, but generally it's a game with roleplaying options of which this game seems to have none other than building your character's stats and skills.

All problems are solved through this game's languid, ponderous, and clunky combat. No non-combat or social options in this supposed RPG. The exploration as as dull and lifeless as the world in which it inhabits. Some scant crafting materials to create some mediocre items with minimal stat gains. Undoubtedly the usual carrot and the stick seen in the MMO sphere influenced this trash itemization.

The dungeons were quite interesting and a more linear experience and I killed Margit after ten or twelve tries. The game's molasses combat was made even more frustrating due to the various technical issues that plague this supposed RPG (Hint it's not an RPG it's just combat pornography) Your character's hitboxes are far too large causing the enemies to strike you frequently when you're clearly outside of their swing radius. There's also numerous frame rate drops making the game's sole feature of combat extremely difficult since the technical execution of the developers lack of talent is holding you back further than the difficulty of the game is.

All in all this game is not an RPG, there are no roleplaying options. It's just combat pornography for the youth's violent masturbatory sadist rituals. If you have any class avoid this buggy mess like the plague it is and cast it into the fire! I for one got a full refund from my local gamestore, but I hope to save others the expense. We all know this game doesn't deserve a perfect score.

Roleplay 0 out of 100

Obviously Mr. H never played his own game or he'd realize that after the first 2 areas the game scales up higher than any souls game I have ever played. It's ridiculous how every fight past liurnia is a constant slog and I must die repeatedly to learn fights or mobs. That's not good game design. Even Sekiro was not like this untill Genichiro. This is beyond pathetic. This is game Developers just being pricks IMO. No need to make a brutal AI that predicts your patterns. That's just being mean and not fun. I am tired of trash mobs slaughtering me despite being near lvl 100, and tired of dying 500 times to a boss because there are no clear patterns other than 1 or two moves to visually see beforehand. I don't get why people like this company, and game. They have not evolved anything other than the world, which I admit is gorgeous. The world they made is truly beautiful but the game you play in it is garbage.

I was exploring 5 hours and i have never felt so empty inside while playing a video game. Souls combat is also awful, i guess some people like predictable combat, but i like chaotic combat. I don't want to learn some move sets, so i could beat this random boss. Souls combat is like chess, you only have certain moves that you have to repeat over and over, that's the whole combat. Assassin's Creed and Witcher combat is way better, you have so much more freedom to choose how, where, when you attack, etc. Very disappointed in Elden Ring, i'm not saying they have to change anything, because clearly some people like this kind of gameplay, but i have feeling that it's more like minority.

The people complaining about it being too hard just don’t have enough patience. It’s not a copy paste of Ds3 the people only played like 3 minutes of Both games. It’s a great game.

The loading speeds is better then PS4,  but it can't compare to game like Demon souls remake.  Elden Ring is less than 45 gig. Demon souls are around 100 gigs.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,2,"From software has been making the same game for the past 10 years. Elden ring is just the new installment on a series of overrated copy and pasted collection of files that their fans have the nerve to “call best game ever made”. Clunky and choppy animations, old art assets, repurpose hero and enemy moves. unpolished lighting. Same old enemy archetypes on new skins.  Zero to none AAA cinematic sequences, unacceptable facial animation. Rubbish storytelling. Outdated AI, bad audio filtering and occlusion. Shading and material errors. performance issues across all platforms; These are issues that haven’t evolved at all on their past souls games. In essences, the souls series are a one of a kind type of experience that I have enjoyed in the pass.  But its 2022 and with games as polish as Red Dead redemption, Last of Us 2, god of war, death stranding and more coming. Its just pretty unfortunate to see gaming news outlets jumping on this 10s crazy thing as if the game is a perfect masterpiece. Fear of backlash maybe? Who knows. Hope this “toxic” quick overview of this new old boring game open some eyes out there. As gamers we should demand better. Don’t change the core of the franchise. But please From Software step up your game in all department. Renew that engine. Get some good animators. Write a coherent story. Make those hero combat animations feel more real. Realistic blood splatters. Dynamic enemy decapitations. Proper cloth and physics simulation. The list of things to bring to your game is honestly a mile long. Or well, like your fans would say.

It’s basically Dark Souls with some Sekiro and Bloodborne elements, set in an open world.However, as some of the more critical people are stating, I agree that the open world is actually TOO big for it’s own good. Even though the dungeons are super neat, I feel like I spend too much time riding around aimlessly on horseback looking for secrets. There is a lot of secrets to find though, but there’s also plenty of big empty areas littered with ruins that look like they could be explorable, but they are not. The horse combat also holds it back a little; when riding a horse, many of the bosses and enemies in the open world becomes very easy and requires little skill, which I think is a shame. Having just finished Sekiro before this, I also feel like that combat is a step back in terms of clunkyness. That being said, it’s still really good and the sense of discovery and wonder is amazing. Not a 10/10 in my book (so far), but still a damn good game.",5,14

"Mar 20, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"For full transparency, I never liked any of the other Souls games. This is my favorite of the Souls games that I have played. This is because the game feels easier, with many battles being optional and the open world allowing for stealth approaches, so it’s more welcoming to people who aren’t diehard fans like myself. The open world definitely makes this the most accessible of all the games, and the way they drop you into the open world with minimal guidance or objectives is very cool. The game forces you to explore which is a pleasure because the world is beautiful. I also like how they encourage natural exploration and curiosity unlike other open world games which flood your minimap with 20 different icons. The game really shines in the aesthetic design of the world and it really feels like it captures the dark fantasy theme, especially the color palettes - the first area has the green colored skies and the golden colored clouds, it almost looks like a metal album cover. The world really is visually stunning, and with each additional section of the map that you uncover, you begin to realize how vast and varying the environments are. The game has interesting lore, but the very spread out story and lack of opportunities to learn more about the lore just make it a visual experience. Even the rare NPC that yoy come across doesn’t really offer anything of interest. The graphics are good, and really add to the intrigue of the world. While it is beautiful and has interesting lore sprinkled throughout, it feels like a bit of a boring world. It’s big, it’s empty, the enemies are randomly scattered throughout, but there isn’t much substance there beyond the visuals. There are few random NPCs, and if you find any, usually it’s one person standing in the middle of nowhere. I do love the aesthetics of the world, unfortunately it’s just a bit of an uninteresting world because it’s rather empty and the lore is way too spread out. The sound is terrible - limited music, repetitive sound effects, generic ambient noise, it’s almost necessary to listen to a podcast or music when you play this game. One thing I always hated about the Souls games was the controls, and there are no different here. It always feels like it’s lacking any fluidity and it feels very rigid, and I don’t understand the praise Souls fans give these robotic motions. Even the button combinations are very confusing - even after ten hours of gameplay I still do the incorrect input during the heat of battle. The AI is also brick stupid, enemies will stop in their tracks to look at you, and if you step back, they just continue following their assigned path. The only major issue I had with the game was that it explains so little, I felt that I had to spend way too much time on Google figuring out how to do something simple like equip a spell. The entire game has a long learning curve - I didn’t care for the first 5 hours of the game at all, but when it clicked with me, I started enjoying it.

All in all, I enjoyed the game more than any of the other Souls games, and I generally disliked most of the others. Adding the open world to the Souls formula was a necessary change to capture a wider audience like myself. I’m hoping future Souls games keep the open world. While the game is nowhere near as good as Breath of the Wild, it does replicate similar feelings of exploration, which I don’t think many games have captured. It’s a good game with a lot to offer, but to call this a perfect game is simply inaccurate. It’s big, it’s beautiful, it’s empty, and it’s clunky.

EDIT: I left my same review up but increased the score from a 7 to an 8. It finally clicked with me. Still not worthy of anywhere near the 97 critic score, but it’s a great game. The bread and butter of the game is its ability to sow natural curiosity and exploration.

EDIT 2: I have never revised an interview once, let alone twice, but I felt compelled to increase the score from an 8 to a 9. The learning curve is brutal, but once it clicks, it’s fantastic. The world is much larger than I initially expected, and I want to continue seeing what more there is, especially since I know I’m nowhere near halfway through the game. Unfortunately I don’t think I’ll ever give it a 10, the narrative is weak, I still find the controls to be cumbersome, I still find the world to be a little too empty. But this game really did blow me away.",10,29

"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"This game ranks amongst one of the best games in the Soulsborne genre, but it STILL lacks what is takes to be a truly great game; or even a 'good' game really.

The graphics are excellent, and the combat controls are relatively responsive, as they need to be in this genre of game. However, that being said, the game falls short on MANY fronts and demonstrates a lack of developer insight into what makes an exceptional game.

While the combat controls are very responsive, the combat in the game often devolves into enemies crowding the player, with the player fighting the in-game camera as much as they are fighting the enemies. This lack of insight, amongst other things, detracts from what could otherwise be a great game.

Competitor 'souls-like' games (e.g. Nioh) so a better job of pacing the combat properly, and offering players some room to actually see what is going on.

Undoubtedly the weebs will shout their lack-of-brain-cells, lemming-like, mantra of 'git gud', but those shouts of mindless of brainless drivel should be directed at the developers, not the players in an effort to get the devs to put forth that 'git gud' effort into overcoming their own barriers, get rid of some of these mindless, idiotic, pacing and crowding issues that mar what could otherwise be a 10/10 game.

Still, all that said, it is still a very 'good' game...and would still a solid 5/10. It really is a 'average' game; but that's just it...it's ok, not 'excellent' or 'exceptional'; it still finds itself leaning on the same tired old soulsborne tropes and cliches. The sole exception to this is that it finally brings magic back into being a viable build.

5/10 would have been as high as it could possibly go with the problems that still exist; and that have existed since the days of the soulsborne infancy.

Unfortunately the Radahn &amp; Fire Giant fights docked additional points because they stand in the way of the player as a 'mandatory' event; and those fights are quite possibly the most terrible fight design I have seen in any modern game. Look to the players, and how many ""cheese"" strategies players come up with for those two fights alone....that's your barometer for how badly you have designed a fight.

Many other boss fights are likewise a gimmick-driven mess, and not remotely 'fun'; which is the purpose of gaming is it not? That's not to say that ALL of the boss fights are bad; I would say a solid 30-40% of them are well-designed and good; however unfortunately for only 30-40% of 'good' content, the customer should only be charged about 30-40% of the MSRP cost of the game.

There's also some Game Design 101 flaws, for example many times you have to ""reload the game world"" in order for changes to take effect (e.g. you turn in a quest, and a new pathway is intended to open up; however nothing will happen until you Fast Travel somewhere, forcing the game world to reload)....I mean, seriously, c'mon From Software, that is like High School level basic game design, you guys are supposed to be pros!

All in all, it's decent, and you definitely get your money's worth from a ""time-spent"" perspective, the game is MASSIVE. So that's a positive. The problem is that From Software still fails to deliver a game that is 100% fun to play. It's about 40% fun, and 60% eye-rolling bad design and annoying. Definitely see some substantial improvements for player experience, but they still have a long way to go.

Definitely not the 10/10 experience that the weebs and fangirls are crying out.

I would have to say the biggest downfall is the continued ""lack of respect"" towards a player's playtime. My time is far too valuable to waste it doing the same things over and over again. If the dev's target audience is grade schoolers or people drawing welfare stipends, okay sure; but for honest working folk, we don't have time for repetitive garbage.

Another issue is EXCEPTIONALLY POOR quest design &amp; quality-assurance testing. There is no 'Quest Log' to track your objectives; and if that isn't cumbersome enough, most of the quests are flat-out broken, with 'triggers' not happening reliably, NPCs not appearing where they are supposed to be, etc.  Honestly, I have seen better 'Quest Design' coming out of High School computer classes; are the folks from the Quest team at From Software actually professionals; or are they just like some elementary school students that they allowed to code for some extra credit for a week?

But this one feels like DS2 with better bosses / environment.
The mechanics are very similar, except for the jump feature.
The character is slow, and it feels like the mechanics of your character are from 2010: just slow and goofy, while the enemies / bosses have more advanced mechanics, its like your character runs at half the speed, and the bosses are 1.5X speed. just weird.

The result is a slow awkward combat system especially when trying to beat a boss.
This game feels like 1000 steps back from DS3, and it is not a standalone franchise, feels and plays like DS2 remake.

Do you get breathtaking and exciting combat? no. all you should do is die too many times just to figure out when and how each enemy attacks, which might be enjoyable for some minority of people, but for most of the people, it just doesn't worth the time and effort.

so the only times you really ""enjoy"" playing this game, is when you have defeated a boss or when you enjoy the beauty of the world itself.

despite all things mentioned above, I admire their risk in creating an open-world game this wast and adding some features like a horse to the series ...

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"To start this off, I am not a fan of the Soulsborne formula and if you feel the same way than this game most likely is not for you.

After the overwhelmingly positive reviews of the media, with Elden Ring being called ""Genre defining and a Masterpiece"", I really wanted to give the game a chance and experience it for myself.

First and foremost the only genre that it is defining is the Soulsborne genre and I think they made a very good transition from an very linear game design to an open world game. So job well done. Soulsborne fans pretty much have to love it. That is also why I give it a 7.

But thats actually it ... there is nothing new in here and nothing that it does better than other well known open world games ... actually it does many things worse. Feels at times really hollow, empty and slow. The graphics are ok, but really nothing to praise, the animations are also pretty okish but look like something from 5 - 10 years ago. Interaction with the world, as in plants that move when you run through them, is non existent ... they just clip through your body.

Can't say much about the performance on my PC it ran well.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"Buddy told me to check this game out I used to play some action games back on the PS2. Not really my jam these days, but I figured what they hell why not. Let me tell you this is no God of War. Booted this game up thought it looked okay, kind of like an old 360 game, but whatever. Must be a good story or something.

Speaking of story I guess other than the one eyed girl and the crappy cutscene there isn't really one. Figured since it had the Game of Thrones writer on it it may be cool, but I guess this is the reason why everyone hates the damned show now. He must not be very good, probably another SJW propped up by the hollywood elites.

Dodge mechanics are pretty clunky and don't seem to work quite right.. Seems like your character's hit box is larger than Nancy Pelosi's slush fund. Clipping seems to guarantee that the enemies kill you through walls and rocks and other crap, but you never seem to go through them. I presume it's some intentional feature to create a faux sense of challenge to the game. The alternative is that the programmers lack the technical wherewithal to pull of what they're striving for. Now that I think on that though it's probably the latter with the number of bugs this game has. Frame rate drops are pretty harsh and consistently occur on boss encounters.

Maybe it would have been a cool game if the story was any interesting or if the developers were worth a lick, but they seem to be reaching for the stars when they can't even grab the dirt off the floor very well. Play God of War any of them and hard if you wanna play a real good game.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Nostalgia. It's big business now. Seems like everyone is cashing in on 80's and 90's kids childhoods. But why? Why are people willing to pay money for something old and possibly obsolete? The simple answer is bliss. That exhilaration of feeling something new, The unlimited Thrill of receiving a reword for achieving what felt like an imposable goal that only a child can know. The first time you were excited and scared at the same time, The friendships...friendships before drama, when the only thing required to be friends was that you were all young and ignorant of an adult world. As we know being an adult isn't nearly as exciting and is rarely fun. So of course people (like me) in there 30's 40's and 50's will pay cash for a chance at feeling that bliss, if only for a single second, if only one more time.

Video games were my very first love. Karate Kid on the NES is the first game I remember playing. And it called to me. The colors racing by, the thrill of surviving one more screen as I scrolled right kicking and punching. Then at the local arcade it was WWF Wrestlefest and Afterburner that gave me that same thrill, That sense of pure bliss. Other games made me feel that way over the years. But it came fewer and farther between as I got older. And it wasn't just games feel this way. It was going to a new friends house for the first time, playing in a construction area at night, riding my first wheelie on my bike, my first ollie, exploring abandoned houses with my friends. when we were kids it was pure bliss all the time.

As life carries on, there are still wonders. the first time being intimate with someone, falling in love, your first promotion at work. But for most of us our day to day life's have become the status quo, go to work, be a good parent, and a good spouse. But no matter how good your life turns out, for a lot of us there will always be a longing for that bliss. That feeling of discovery we had so many years ago.

Eldon Ring absolutely makes me feel that way again. I cant exactly say why. I never liked any of the other games made by FROM software. In fact I disliked them. But this game has kept me on the edge of my seat for the 30 hours I've put into it. I'm glued to my TV in a way that I haven't been for years. My heart races, and my adrenaline has been off the charts! Not just the game either, I've had my laptop In front of me the whole time, on forums, wiki's, and watching YouTube videos. Its the most ""fun"" I've had as long as I can remember.  Around every corner is something new and exciting, every cave, Ruin, or castle is just absolutely filled with discovery. The constant fear of losing your progressions is ever looming giving this game that fear and excitement feeling from my youth. There is nothing like discovering an area with no messages anywhere and knowing you might be the first player to ever find this place. It's constant exhilaration.

I could get into the mechanics, the graphics, what features the game has or lacks. But I wont. I could talk about the length of the game. But I also wont, Because for me it doesn't matter. Im 30 hours in and if the game ended now, or lasted another 100 hours I would consider it the greatest game ever made. What I do care about is how this game makes me feel. And it makes me feel like a kid again. Not for a second, but for hours. I never thought I would feel these kinds of emotions again. And for that I am so thankful.

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"So I have had a colossal amount of fun with this game and went on here to read what others are saying and boy was I surprised, until I read the reviews. They have fundamentally misunderstood what this game is, and isn't. And some complaints are just petty.

Most of the negative reviews seem to not understand the well established formula that FromSoftware games have had for 15 years. Why would they change it now?

No the game doesn't have a quest-log. For me this adds to the immersion and my curiosity. How do I reach that tower? Where did that NPC say he was going next? This is also a formula that FromSoftware has worked with since Demon's souls and harkens back to RPG:s and adventure games from the 1990:s so I don't understand the outrage.

The game can be hard, yes, but why should all games be for all people? I don't particularly like Naughty dogs games but if you do then more power to you. I'm not gonna write a review on Uncharted saying I wish it had enormous swords instead of guns and rate it 0. That would be dumb. I understand that those games are not for me.

There most certainly is a story. Again, this storytelling technique might not be for everyone but it has worked for FromSoftware for a long time and I for one quite like it. Why do people think they would then release a linear cinematic experience when that is not the kind of game they make. This honestly baffles me.

This is already my favorite game of the last few years and on my top ten. And I'm not even close to done with it. There's so much to explore, bosses to kill and upgrades to get. It has given me a sense of childlike wonder like no other game has for ages.

It does have some performance issues but I haven't encountered any game breaking or lasting issues on PS5. I'm also sure that the frame rate issues are gonna get patched out in a matter of weeks.

This game is huge and is getting bigger with every stone I turn. I accidentally found a huge hidden city with two boss fights in it. I was in that moment awestruck by the sheer scale of this game. In my opinion, if you like RPG/adventure games and is OK with dying as a game mechanic, this game is a must play and for me the experience is a 10/10.

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"So either there are a lot of trolls or a lot of people who started the game died a couple times and then came here to leave a 0. This game is fantastic and this is coming from someone who has only completed one FromSoft game with it being Sekiro. I have played the other games and own most of them.  And anyone saying that these games don't innovate have zero idea what their talking about. The reason this game works so well is because it is using and fine-tuning everything that came before it. Someone on here says, ""All you do is spam L1 and R1"". Yeah good luck breaking enemy guards without using shield parries, jump attacks , charge attacks, and your special abilities. ""The world is boring""  You must not have left the main menu. This is the most natural and varied world design of any open world game. Period. You can't go five minutes in any direction without running into something of interest, whether that be an enemy, hidden area or even just an amazing view. Sure the engine they use is dated and needs some serious updating. But they used their art direction to it's fullest and the game looks gorgeous for how old the engine is. The game has bigs and stutters but nothing I have seen on my Base PS4 that leads me to feel it can't be fixed with a patch or two. The music, character and monster design, the world flow and design. All of it is top notch. And then you have the different builds and abilities you use that give each character numerous ways to play. They also changed how progression works. Before if a boss was too hard you were pretty much stuck until you could get past them. Now if someone is kicking your teeth in, just leave. Yup. Go adventure. Find other things to do. Find new gear and spells. Come back when you're more prepared. That takes a massive load of of any new players because the fun isn't just put on hold until you can beat this boss. You can go have fun elsewhere. So yeah, as someone who was very skeptical if they would like this game let me say that this is a game that needs to be experienced and don't let some troll tell you otherwise.",1,3

Graficamente o game está lindo por se tratar de um game projetado inicialmente para PS$ e Xone. Quanto as otimizações e framerate, nem de longe chegam a atrapalhar a jogatina, o jogo é imenso desafiador e épico, é possível perceber o cuidado da equipe em cada detalhe!!

Either it is unbalanced or it is full poorly designed as trying to read your controller input. WTF, I’m so done with it as I love souls and I wanted a souls with proper boss fight not fking spamming L2 but learn pattern and doge properly. Fk u FS why for the FK sake just to compliment for the major casual player base? To sell more? Fk u FS really, don’t tell me the fking dlc bosses will be again this bad.",1,3

The story is complicated. The gameplay is hard but rewarding. The open world-ness is on per with Botw.. The background music does not distract you from combat and bosses move in rhythm to music.

I haven't finished the game and I already think this game is the best game of all time. Only reason it's getting negative reviews is that it's too hard for casual gamers and because people don't have a good enough system to play the game due to chip shortages and scalping..

Razor-sharp combat mechanics reward perseverance and skill whilst punishing the impulsive with the swift admonishment of death. There is almost too much to do yet still, there are no dull moments.

At first the map seemed so small, but it is so packed with content that now I feel that the world is just enormous. I love the game. It definitely is going to be replayable as most of From games. Still Bloodborne is my all-time favourite.",1,3
"Mar 22, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I normally don't get on metacritic to post a review, but I adamantly disagreed with a lot of the negative reviews I've seen. I can understand that it might not be the game for everyone, especially if you don't enjoy exploring, but a lot of the reviews just seemed unfairly negative.

I've played all the Dark Souls games minus Sekiro, and I believe Elden Ring is more than worth the hype that it's been given. It has these amazingly designed difficult bosses and less run-back time thanks to the Marika Statues that act as checkpoints. On top of that the world is absolutely breathtaking, not because the graphics are particularly amazing but because of how the world itself is designed and its artistic direction.

The best part about Elden Ring is that if a specific boss feels too hard there are tons of ways to make it easier if you're struggling. You can summon a plethora of different kinds of summons or you can summon some people online to help you with a boss. In addition, if you don't want to do either of those, you can just go to a castle off in the distance, a cave or ruins marked on your map, or just let whimsy take you. This exploration when you get stuck on a boss you feel underleveled for helps alleviate some of that rage you built up from bashing your head against it over and over again.

Either way, there are some minor flaws in this game, but I just feel that nearly all the design decisions for Elden Ring were amazing. I currently have about 180 hours into the game, and I'll probably put double that in before I put the game down for a break.",1,3
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I can't believe how they managed to nail everything so well. The combat is clean, varied, satisfying, challenging. Exploration is eventful, the world is full of unique stuff, it's clearly all crafted and not generated. There's also a huge amount of content here, you'll easily spend 20+ hours in just the first area if you explore everything. The music, the voice acting, the overall sound design are so good and fit the game so well. There's also a lot of creativity that shines through with the characters, the boss designs and such. Also, it's just so damn beautiful. Having just played Demon's Souls Remake before this, I expected the change to feel pretty bad, but I have to admit, the game just looks amazing. Lots of natural looking vegetation placement, the terrain and buildings all look great, lighting and VFX match the theme and give a great feel. I didn't believe it could top some of the other From games for me, yet it managed to do that with flying colours in every aspect.

There are no stutters on PS5, although the game sometimes goes below 60FPS in the open world when things are getting heated. It's also unfortunate to see that people are pushing so hard against cross-gen, cross-platform releases like this, and saying that the game looks dated. I don't know where you get your standards, but you either need to consider that a game like DeSR was made specifically for the PS5, taking full advantage of the hardware, and having an easier time doing so, since the game is relatively closed in structure OR they should consider that in year 2022 we still have a game like Legends Arceus releasing (for the same price) and people saying how great it looks. You're all insane.",1,3
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,Los modos de dificultad simplemente agregan opciones para que la gente pueda poner la experiencia a su propio nivel. A la gente de From Software le gusta hacer gatekeeping. Va un 0 por no tener modo fácil.,1,3
"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"Its hilarious to me that in all the 0s and 1s review this game is getting, they can only complain about the graphics being last gen and lack of cutscenes. Nothing screams GIT GUD more than seeing reviews like this. Im glad fromsoft have stuck to their guns and kept the handholding out of their games as is their tradition.

Now for the fromsoft veterans who havent bought this game yet for whatever reason, know that I am only docking points because the endgame areas and bosses have noticeably bad balance compared to maybe 75% of the game. The 6 hardest bosses in this game have maybe 1 second of openings every 30 seconds which makes the fights insanely long

I also dont like how they have introduced the spirit ash mechanics. Spirit ashes are summons that you can upgrade. There are also NPC summons like in previous games but spirit ashes when upgraded are far stronger. There are 5 legendary ashes which summon spirits that are essentially stronger than your own character when leveled up to the max.

This has caused a lot of elitism and anti elitism since they are considered a mechanic of the game unlike NPC summons. Head over to the reddit page for ER and theres posts every day bashing the veterans who dont like using summons

Obviously you can say ""Just dont use them""

The issue is again those 6 hardest bosses and their balance showing. If you use the ashes the fights are a minute long. If you dont, a successful attempt can be up to 8 minutes with these endgame bosses!",1,3
"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,4,"This has to be one of the most overhyped and overrated games of the decade. This game has officially made me think there’s something seriously wrong with gaming journalism and media. I’m dumbfounded by the perfect scores this Game has garner. Games this hard are not fun! A life this hard is not fun. What if every little thing you did in life was literally torture. Well this is Elden Rings. First off the graphics are no where close to Demons Souls Remake on PS5. After playing Horizon Forbidden West on PS5, I’m in pure  shock how bad the graphics are in Elden Rings. I was even more taken back by the frame rate. The graphics looks last gen in high resolution if not worst. The frame rate is not as smooth as you would expect especially if you’re used to 60 fps.The difficulty is also one of the biggest big turn offs. I’m sincerely not a fan of games as a torture. Games that make you want to throw your controller are not fun and will never be fun. Games should give you a sense of wonder and awe and Elden Rings fails to do this for me. The open world feels dead compared to Horizon Forbidden West. The world does not feel alive, Elden Rings feels empty and void of substance.Games should be fun, accessible and make you want to come back. Elden Rings feels like a total waste of money. I wish games like this would just die!",1,3

"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"It started fun but dropped off severely when its gameplay put itself through a wringer. High intensity fights let large issues shine through. This is on PS5. There is the atrocious combo of input delay accompanied by input stacking. You are punished for playing reactively rather than predictively, despite reaction based gameplay being a large part of souls-like games. The input delay can get you slammed with unfair hits you would have dodged otherwise, and then the input stacking will take the action you WANTED to do, and force you to do it after it's needed, at a time where it will most likely cost you. This game is on next gen and has been in development for 13 years with tons of FromSoft release to learn from. There is no excuse for this poor design and such simple technical issues. It could be so much better, but the way it limits itself through these issues makes it unfun and awkward.",1,3

I played every game from fromsoftware except Demons Souls and at the time I liked each and everyone of them. Apart from Sekiro, wich is the best gameplay that I ever experienced, the Dark Souls mechanics feels really dated nowadays and make no mistake: Elden Ring is essencially Dark Souls in a open world. This is basicaly Dark Souls 4. IF YOU LIKE DARK SOULS AND IS NOT FATIGUIED like me, YOU SHOULD BUY IT. But if you thought that after titles like Sekiro and Bloodbourne, Fromsoftware was ready to bring yet another exciting game with diferent mechanics and more over the top Boss fights, this isn't the game for you. This should have been a 5, but performance is really poor so a 3 should suffice.",1,3
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Amazing game. If you liked any past From Software game you'll love Elden Ring. The game is great. Gameplay is definitely great, similar to DS3 but with new stuff. The open world is really nice, I don't know how people are saying it's empty, IT'S LITTERALY FULL OF STUFF, every new place has something new. The game is enormous, it seems it won't end. I played for 20 hours and I'm still probably at 10% of the total game. It has issues of course,  framerate drops, stuttering, pop in, and stuff at a distance is really bad to look at. But the game is great, from software always had some problems at optimizing their game but in the end it's the fun you have and they make great games. It's not definitely a 10 but because people are giving it a 0 which is crazy, i'm givint it a 10, normal vote would be 9. Play the game before saying it's empty.

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"Is this the ring to rule them all? The game of the decade, the best game ever? The best Soulsbourne game from FromSoftware? That’s for fans of this type of game to decide.

Are the graphics last gen? As a generational cross-platform title they are fine and the visual design is breath taking.

Is it easier than previous games from the developer? Having tried a couple of previous games I’d agree that it is more ‘accessible’. I spent many hours roaming around the huge map – as long as I didn’t engage in combat (exploring, not lost! lol). I’m sure with enough (and constant) grinding and learning the mechanics and routines of enemies I could progress – maybe even finish the game. But having spent several increasingly boring hours ‘farming’ the same spot I’ve decided that it’s not for me and I’d guess some other gamers having been persuaded by the very pro reviews will be disappointed. Others will love the pain and eventual gain.

The PS5 version is buggy. The game has been compared to Skyrim, however, apart from a fantasy setting the only other, significant, aspect it shares with it, is the distracting pop-in and other bugs that SR had on launch.

Overall, ER reminded me not of SR but, in some elements, Dragons Dogma (which I enjoyed) - with a huge dollop of Farming Simulator 22 (lol).

ER has a world and intriguing lore I know I would love to further explore, but not at the price of dodging the same rock for 5 hours to level up to beat some grunts. Perfect for FromSoftware fans new and old – who may see it as (their) 'the best best game ever'. Everyone else should take the hype and promise of accessibility with a pinch of salt.",1,3

Then for the gameplay, as a mage you'll experience some ""fun"" at the beginning but this fun will rapidly decreased since you're going to be more and more useless by the time spent on the game (lack of damage...). It clearly impact too much of the gameplay for me. There is even an invisible ""boss"" that you can barely kill just because you're a mage. And if you forget the gameplay as a mage, this game is good but that just don't deserve a 10/10 review like a lot of people did, too much hype just for that...

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,Good game and enjoy the open world. Not a huge soils fan as I don’t enjoy dying endlessly. I play games to have fun and I didn’t find souls games fun. The first few hours of this game are good. The bosses are just as difficult as souls games though and require multiple tries for some of them. The one good thing is you can just leave a boss fight and go do other things. Great exploration and I’m sure I’m missing a ton of things. The combat is a bit clunky. Overall not necessarily my game of the year but I am enjoying parts of it. Prefer horizon though.,1,3
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"I would have given a 10 if the controls were easier..

I play the game on PC and I haven't had any frame rate issues.  I have a Geforce RTX 2060, 32GB of DDR4, SSD Drive and Intel i7-10700F processor.  I am an experience gamer, I have been playing games since 1990 roughly.  This game is a huge challenge and it has a learning curve, if you are into either of those jump right in.  If you are looking for something you can easily hack and slash your way through, look elsewhere.  Most people whining about the game are probably doing so because they couldn't take the time to figure it out.  The game does minimal hand holding and I mean minimal.  With enough gameplay time under your belt you will start to figure out the nuances of the game.  I find the graphics very nice on PC and I have no frame rate problems.  My only complaint is the huge learning curve on mouse/keyboard controls.  it seems the devs wanted a minimal hud, because you can take it away with a push of a key.  No hotbars, no nothing, just key bindings.  Thankfully I have a mouse and keyboard where I can assign keystrokes to mouse keys and it makes it easier but hotbars would help.  They should give the player the option on whether or not to use them.  I am really enjoying the game so far though.  Understand that when you initially start playing you will die fast and start thinking the game sucks.  You have to keep going after that to see the beauty in this game.  If you have a nice PC, this is a must have.  I can't speak for the quality of the game on consoles.",1,3
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"2011 saw the release of two of the most influential games for the RPG genre, dark souls and Skyrim. One was a complex and mysterious game, with some of the greatest level designs in modern gaming - and the other was an adventure through a seemingly limitless fantasy world. Both were fantastic games in their own right, but even back then I always dreamed of a Skyrim with the addictive combat and difficulty of dark souls, and likewise I dreamed of a dark souls that had the sandbox freedom of Skyrim.Fast forward to 2022 and this dream has been realised. The open world element of Elden Ring reinvigorates the souls-like core gameplay symbiotically. The great level design and inter connectivity of dark souls is still here, and so is the great combat and progression. But now we have a huge open world full of secrets to uncover. In dark souls sometimes the difficulty could be suffocating, with your only option to “get gud” and grind your way through a dastardly place like Sen’s Fortress. In Elden Ring when things get hard you can teleport across the map and set off in a direction of your choosing. Levelling up while uncovering lore rich dungeons and points of interest.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"The most fun I’ve had in an open world game since BOTW. Looks beautiful on PC. I barely played an hour of Sekiro and a few unsuccessful hours of DS3 but I immediately feel so much more comfortable and motivated to explore and progress in Elden Ring. I’m not too worried about performance issues, because I’m sure it’ll be patched up soon (and then become a 10/10 for me). Aside from the fantastic enemies and graphics and open ended nature of combat, the traversal feels so good with the mount, Torrent. I also appreciate the little things - being able to jump, still parry, more magic, more color (far less dreary and bland, but still very dreadful and sinister at times). I also enjoy knowing that taking out a horde may refill flasks, or that I can spawn close to an important area even without the “bonfires” I’m sure players are so used to relying on. There isn’t as much back tracking or pointless treks back to a boss because you can go anywhere so easily. I’m very happy with the game so far.",1,3

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Absolutely phenomenal game. It's combat is far more refined than in from's previous games, its story is huge and mysterious, and its open world is vast and extremely dense. Unfortunately, many people who think that The Last Of Us: Part II's graphics were low to mid-end appear to believe that elden ring looks like its from the 2000's. Although its graphics aren't the peak of the medium right now, I find it impossible to call them bad in good faith, and even if they were, Hidetaka Miyazaki's incredible art direction would make up for it ten-fold. Additionally, many people who have obviously missed the point are arguing that the story is lack-lustre because they can't be bothered to search for it, and prefer to have their story spoon-fed to them as if they were toddlers. there is nothing wrong with this approach to story-telling, but saying that a game is bad because it does not use it is simply childish. Additionally, many negative critics are arguing about other aspects of the game in the same way. they argue that because the game doesn't have swimming, or doesn't have climbing, or doesn't have flying makes the game automatically bad, even though the map was carefully curated with these constraints in mind. by the way, if you see any reviewers saying that the game has an empty open world, or that the environmental design is all the same, or that the combat is the clunkiest out of any of the souls games, or that enemies are recycled from the other souls games, it would be a fair assumption to assume that they have not even played the game or at the very least never left the starting area, as there were people planning on review-bombing the game before it even released, mostly in order to make Horizon: Forbidden West look better, and all of these things are so obviously false that not even a child would have the misfortune of thinking of this game in any of those ways. the one aspect of the game that all of the negative reviewers are saying that is actually correct (other than the language options in other countries and whatnot) is that the performance isn't the best. sometimes the frame rate drops to 30 fps, but it really doesn't take me out of the experience at least and it's pretty hard to tell the difference in my opinion, although I have a past of not caring about frame rates much, if at all. if you are a stickler for frame rates, then I suggest you wait until a patch comes out to fix it, but otherwise I suggest you ignore the people giving the game overwhelmingly negative reviews, because this game is worth far more than every penny of its cost, and I think that almost every person deserves to play it.",1,3
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"They have taken the winning formula of their previous games: breath-taking varied locations, a ridiculous range of enemies, difficult but rewarding combat, and way too much choice, then added even more choice. The game world is truly spectacular, with each environment being beautiful in its own way. I'm about 15 bosses in and they're exactly what I'd expect from a Soulsborne game so no complaints there. The combat is as good as their other games, but feels fresh and more customisable with additions like ashes of war, spirit ashes, the wondrous physick flask, and cracked/other pots. The thing that really sets this game apart is the endless variety of the world, there is a ridiculous amount of meaningful, distinct content.

Elden Ring has an incredible amount passion and intention behind even the smallest little details and mechanics sprinkled across the world. This kind of polish is not often seen in AAA games anymore unfortunately. Looking at this game from an artistic standpoint, the scenery, architecture and atmosphere of this world is unmatched by almost any other game I've played. The open world feels lively and has a rich presence that invites exploration which you are actually rewarded for unlike many other 'open world' games. The story is intriguing and fairly accessible to follow unlike the prior souls games. From software really has outdone themselves with this game and it deserves all the praise it is receiving.

There are some small performance issues including stuttering and FPS drops that some players are experiencing after release. I have not experienced any of these issues that hinder my enjoyment or experience so I left this out my score.",1,3

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"**CONCEPT/9**

Open world Dark Souls with increased everything, lore, size, weapons, combat options, bosses, enemy types, the list goes on and on. Personally, I wish the story was told in a more traditional way instead of the usual cryptic style of storytelling from other FromSoft games.

**GRAPHICS/8**

Beautiful design and art. Unimpressive framerate and it looks just like Dark Souls 3 at times.

**SOUND/10**

Amazing music and voice acting. The ambience overall is incredible.

**GAMEPLAY/9**

You have so much freedom to do what you want that you don’t have to take on any bosses if they are too difficult. The beginning of the game still doesn’t tell you much but once you get through the initial hours, the formula and layout of the game will become clear. I felt the game was too big and open at times with not enough interesting things to do and see in each zone but the zones themselves are designed real well. I also wish there were more secrets hidden in obscure spots within the zones.

**SUMMARY/10**

The game is a brilliant way forward for Dark Souls games. It’s one of the best open world games I’ve ever played.",1,3

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,4,"Elden Ring despite what I was hoping didn't do anything new to the FromSoft formula, besides add an open world. Alone that wouldn't warrant a negative review, but the combat gets clunkier and clunkier each new game as the bosses get faster and faster. It felt mandatory for each boss to have an AOE attack, a ranged attack, and some type of drawn out combo that afterwards gives you about two hits of room before it's back to unrelenting dodging. Exploring the open world was my favorite aspect of the game. It was fun getting sidetracked trying to get better gear or advance an NPCs quest. But after that it was back to running headfirst into mandatory bosses that are just way, way to fast for the combat. It felt like after Bloodborne Fromsoft wanted to move in a direction of more constant and relentless combat, but haven't found, atleast to me, an enjoyable balance between player and boss. It's not a bad game, it's just one that I feel falls very short of its predecessors, doesn't expand on the combat system that's becoming rapidly dated with new boss designs.

The story is the same as other fromsoftware games but a new setting. Insert fantasy land, insert event that breaks it apart, mandatory magic/religious/intellectual institute. It's not bad, it's just not new. But the real story comes from the characters and there quests, which are on par with other Fromsoft games. After six previous games of the same story telling formula I would have liked to see a bit more direction with NPC quests, especially in an open world game, as when an NPC tells you to go meet this other person but without any direction it can become very tedious trying to track them down. Most people likely just went to a wiki or guide, and I can't blame them.

Overall if you're a returning Fromsoft fan they're is a good chance you'll enjoy it, but don't hold your hopes to high about sizable change in the formula, and if you had issues with it before they're going to come back here.",1,3

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,6,"Elden Ring, the successor to the series of games that gained renown for the variety of enemies, character builds, arsenal of weaponry, memorable boss fights, level design, the combat and … it’s lack of cohesion in their story.

All this can be found in this game with the exception that the world environment has been massively expanded in an open world format.

I can fathom that all the Fan’s who fell in love with those previous games will massively dive headstrong into this one.

I am not one of those Fans. I have zero experience in previous FromSoftware games. However, I had many expectations considering the marketing build up of this game. Let’s look at the achievements thus far with this game; the expanded level design in an open world format.

This game comes in with an open world that is filled with a variety of enemies, items, bosses, dungeons, secret routes, hidden NPCs and even teleportation devices which you can discover on your own. The size is massive in scale and density.

The density of a particular area involves multiple levels in verticality consisting of beaches, ravines, rivers, swamps, deserts, cliffs, mountain paths, mountain tops and some hidden dungeon that leads you to a whole new underground map. Anywhere you go there is a sense of intrigue built upon the excellent artistic style and the unique architecture of far away landmarks.

While at ground level, you see the cliffs beside you and you head in a direction to discover a path to the top. At the cliff's edge or at a bridge, you pan the camera  constantly to see if there are ways you can jump down to the ravine below safely. You see a far off island and discover an under passage that leads to it. You look at the map and see a dead end to discover explorable catacombs. Every time you venture off in exploration, 80% of the time you find a reward that furthers your character. Be it upgrades, new weapons, new spells, new summons, new armor, new bosses or even finding an NPC that has their own side quests. This is a great incentive system to keep the player engaged and continue this play loop. The only catch here is that the player has to find their way to make this loop work. Leading to my next point, navigating in this world.

I want to mention that this game is the least accessible game I have ever played in an open world game. There are no mini-maps, no waypoints, no side quest tracker or written item descriptions that give clear indication to the next destination or side content. The world map comes with these markers that clearly tells the player to go fill it out themselves.

There are subtle markers in the world that point to places of interest. Like these birds, that faces off into the distance and you wonder what they are looking at. Is there something there? Then there are these weird looking statues, or a dim glowing flame in the darkness of a blue misty night. These point to side contents while, the main campaign direction, if you check the map, there are these large yellow arrows that point you to a general direction. Usually it is not hard if you ride in that direction, to discover the largest and most impressive structure is probably where you need to go.

The sense of  mystery, exploration, discovery and reward actually reminds me of past JRPGs. In those world maps, you wander aimlessly to try and discover for yourself side dungeons, towns and the next destination that would drive the story forward. Given this, I don’t mind but actually give appreciation that FromSoftware has taken this approach and applied it to a world as rich in diversity and density in the lands in between.

This reminds me of what video games were like garnishing feelings of mystery, exploration, discovery and reward. This is the main concept that was applied to this game and it is a proud achievement.

As I traverse this vast and immersive world, I find myself asking questions about the location, the enemies and the backstories to them. There is so much unexplained lore that gives breath to the unique settings in which it is pivotal to this game and the driving core of the player’s engagement.

What type of creatures are these (plant pods), why are there zombie soldiers roaming the land, why is this Godrick so salty and began attaching people’s arms to himself, why are there giants chained to pull this cart, what’s the story behind these dragons, what is this underground place and have this guy hanging upside down, why are there so many chairs here and so many more questions.

Overall, I feel this game is a bit overrated considering the simplicity in their combat system, the terrible controls, the lack of a driving and invoking story, the inexcusable inaccessibility of options, heck there is no pause button in this game, the flat and mono thematic music. The only part this game gets right is the world building and the variety of enemies. Sorry not sorry, this game is no masterpiece.",1,3

"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is honestly one of the best games that I have ever played. As of the time of writing, I have over 85 hours in the Lands Between. After reading a couple of the other reviews on here, there are some things that I would like to address from my perspective.

Graphics: The graphics in this game are absolutely gorgeous. What makes this statement true for me is the art direction. The masterful use of the full color palate had me literally putting my controller down to just take in what I was looking at. While the textures are high quality, they are not as high as other games and I suspect that this is where the complaint originates.

Empty World: If a reviewer is using the phrase ""empty world,"" they either have not played the game or define empty very differently than I do. This game is bursting at the seams with content. While this may not be readily apparent as there will be no map markers, their are dungeons littering the map, ranging from relatively small to insanely expansive. An example from the first area: I discovered a well with an elevator. After beginning to ride the lift, I realized that it was going so much further down than I could have ever predicted. When it finally came to a stop, I was in a completely new area of the game, where I needed to find a new piece of the map. This was all under a different masterfully packed open world area. Almost all of these dungeons culminate with a new boss encounter. The map is also full of ruins/encampments to defeat, bosses roaming the map, as well as unique encounters that only happen at certain times of day. I spent almost 20 hours exploring the opening area ALONE.

Repetitive Combat: In FROMSOFT games, the combat is defined typically by spamming the button for light attacks. This is made more enjoyable by the unique enemy design. Unlike most games, souls games were able to introduce (at least one but normally at least 2) new enemy types in every single area of the game. This doesn't sound like a lot until you realize DS1 had 24 areas to explore before the DLC came out. Elden Ring is not only much larger, with exponentially more areas and unique enemies, but it also has more unique weapons with expansive move sets, AND DEEPER COMBAT after adding the posture break mechanic, jump attacks, guard counters, customizable weapon abilities and mounted combat. This does not even include the completely revamped magic system with countless spells.

Good luck fellow Tarnished!",2,7
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Playing on the ps5 verision of this game was slightly better than the ps4 but stuttering and pop in are still a big issue even on the ps5. Even then the core game play is so mediocre. And it pains me to say it but this game is easily the worst from software game I played to date. I was so hyped for this game after it's reveal and after playing dark souls 1 and 3, bloodborne, sekiro, and even deracine, I expected this game to be the best part of all them. But if anything, they just removed the best aspects of their previous games, from the beautiful levels that were handcrafted to near perfection, elden ring just doesn't have that. The open world of limgrave although stunning to look at first eventually devolves into bland empty grass fields with groups of brain dead ai scattered across. It's not even worth fighting them due to how little runes you get after clearing them. There's also dungeons that are about as pointless to explore due to how uninteresting it is to explore with the final boss at the end just being copy pasted from other areas, honestly i don't get what's so special about the open world at all, if anything it drastically ruins the flow of the game. There's also static npc's you could find stand around all day and night barely moving to just spout exposition at you while you're character just stands there when you talk them. The core combat is fine but it's just dark souls 3 again which after sekiro feels like a big step backwards. Overall spent around 15 hours in the game and absolutely dreading playing more, so I think I'll just call it quits and say this game isn't for me",2,7

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Adding an open world to the dark souls concept made it even better. Had my doubts in how they were gonna make an open world work in this kind of game but they succeeded beyond my expectations. Really enjoyed the addition of mounted combat and faster, easier traversal through your mount that's able to double jump. Its dark souls in bigger better package which can't go wrong.

Pretty sad to see ppl who've heard about dark souls in the past give horrible reviews because they heard open world and expected GTA or Far Cry, complaining about trivial things they personally don't like or even about it being too similar to dark souls, even tho all From games work this way. Which of all could be seen in trailers way before release, so there's really no excuse. And i doubt the majority of them even bought the game.

If you enjoy dark souls games or just punishing but fair games, i highly recommend this. But if you've tried any of the dark souls games in the past and didn't like them, then you'll probably won't like this one either",2,7

Fun for anyone who wants to experience Dark Souls or want some sort of gaming challenge.

But there is no deep story to it. Just figure out how and defeat the bosses. Why? Because they exist.
Open-world just let you choose which bosses you want to fight.

I prefer games with stories not just open-world full of different types of creatures to defeat. I prefer games with technical innovation, graphical innovation, deep story, intriguing conversations and characters.

The graphics is outdated, the combat system is outdated and there is no story.

It doesn't have enough ""living"" in the open world to feel alive, the bosses and enemies are really the part where it shines.  It's not as good as Sekiro by far.  The plot is lackluster, it seems like they wanted to push the BOTW + Dark Souls angle but the problem with BOTW is that the story suffers for the wondering, explorative world and it was 'okay' that the world felt empty.  It feel like a single player MMO experience and you are all alone.

I do not feel the game deserves the 10/10.  A 10/10 game means that people who are not just dark souls players could enjoy it. I half enjoyed it, half got bored of the empty world.  I was so hyped and it has nothing to do with the mechanics, it's just not what I thought it was going to bed.

I think it got a perfect 10/10 because people want to relive dark souls.  If you wanna relive Dark Souls + BOTW type stuff? This is your jam! If you want more than beautiful scenary and dark souls, go someplace else.",4,16

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"İch kann den hype und die ganzen positiven Bewertungen nicht verstehen. Die Grafik sieht auf der PS5 aus als würde man ein PS3 Game spielen. Steuerung und mechanik aus der Steinzeit. Das Spiel ist nicht im geringsten Einsteiger freundlich. Hier kommen nur die aktuell vorhandenen Dark Souls Spieler auf ihre Kosten. Für Neueinsteiger ist das Spiel nichts. Man sagte mir, dass ich mir die alten Dark Souls Spiele kaufen muss damit ich Elden Ring verstehe und ordentlich spielen kann. Sorry aber das werde ich mir sicher nicht antun. Für mich ist Elden Ring ein Fehlkauf des Jahres. İch kann das Spiel nicht empfehlen.",2,8
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,Most overated game I've ever. Combat is boring and repetitive. The graphics just are not up to par with other games now days.

"Mar 10, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,It blows my mind how when you go the subreddit to get advice on how to beat a boss the only answer you’ll get is “respec into a magic character” Many reviewers praised this game for “allowing us to play the build we want” and once you reach the late game that statement couldn’t be farther from the truth. This is why reviewers shouldn’t give a game 10/10 when they haven’t even finished the thing.,2,8
"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Many AAA games bored me, with their same third party mechanics and high production values.  They are basically the same games but with a high budgeted veneer. Enter Elden Ring, Fromsoft's masterpiece will kick your a@# so hard like their previous games, but creates a world so vast and so dangerous that you will be addicted to explore every nook and cranny.  If Zelda is Miyamoto's dream then Elden Ring is its polar opposite, a nightmare that you will  not want to wake up from, until you mastered and conquered it, probably hundreds of hours later.",1,4

But the essence of crawling through dungeons reminiscing the challenging areas that are hallmarks of the series is still there. The exploration adds a whole new aspect to the game that I never knew I needed in a souls game, but I gladly appreciate now. All in all, the combat is good as always, if not better with a plethora of options on how you can build the way you like to play. Give this game a chance, it might not be for everybody, but this one sure is more welcoming than the previous ones.",1,4

"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I tried this game on PC. I couldn't play it because of horrible performance issues and no ultrawide support (it's 2022 FFS).

However, that being said - I didn't want to wait for patches (which may or may not happen) to play this game so I sucked it up; bought a PS5, and went to town.

Best decision I've made in quite some time - I was very much looking at putting down video games for a more casual experience potentially looking at chilling out with borderline basic games like The Last of Us. The best way of describing it was complete gaming fatigue, too many games are filled with overbearing HUDs, hand-holding and damn micro-transactions. The practices of the industry are shameful and honestly make me want to quit playing games altogether.

That being said. If there's an 'Elden Ring' of games every couple of years. I'll be sticking around. The last game I can comfortably say I enjoyed this much was Breath of The Wild.",1,4

"Mar 20, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"First and foremost, quite a massive game.  Theres no shortage of content.That being said, ER is easily the most accessible From Software game on the market.  Though some enemies can be more difficult than past Dark Souls, the fact you can overlevel so easily plus the better balance of MANY types of builds and improved combat system helps a ton in making it easier than its predecessors.  Its also much easier to regain lost Runes after death making death itself feel a lot less daunting.The open world gameplay is definitely well-done for the most part.  I love the freedom and exploration along with the mystery.  Though I would have enjoyed a bit better AI in the open world with greater variation (sometimes feels bland with the AI being overly scripted).  All-in-all, the game does well at staying true to its Dark Souls roots within the open world.That being said, ER is easily the WORST graphics of the new generation of games (pretty much just Dark Souls 3).  Highly outdated and this was quite disappointing for a game that has such excellent atmosphere and art design.  Not only that, but clear performance issues which is unusual for a game that is graphically inferior, has weaker AI systems, and not that much in the way of physics compared to most modern games, especially when compared to Horizon Forbidden West which is incredible what those devs did.  In ER, you will have pop-in left and right of foliage.  Rendering distance is pathetic on certain objects.  Often frame rate drops (im on performance mode btw).  Lip syncing is abysmal.  Enemies just outright disappear when they leave their 'zones'. Honestly, this is uncalled for especially for a game that is not focused on the graphics.  Performance should be flawless in a game like this. This is a major reason I knocked it down a couple points.  In my opinion, From Software needs to sit down and spend time on their game engine choice.  For how long this game took (similar to Horizon), if they used say the Decima Engine or even the Unreal Engine but kept their atmosphere and art design style, this game would have been mind blowingly good.  Unfortunately, this sets it back in the current era.Also, there's  a bit too much in the way of reused assets.  Not a bad thing overall BUT does make things feel a little bit ""cheaper"" in production.  For example, Bloodborne did a good job of remaining to its roots but adding some fresh feel to the game with new gear concepts and enemies.  Elden Ring really just feels like Dark Souls 3 in an (excellent) open world setting and vastly improved combat system.  A bit more could have been done to differentiate it I feel.  I think part of this ""feeling"" is because of the dated graphics but still, AI could have been improved to be more organic in the open-world setting.  Too many scripted pieces.In the end, still a great game.  Definitely worth it for the gameplay alone.  Just not ""next gen"" nor is it entirely revolutionary.  Its mainly Dark Souls 3 in an open world with improved and greatly balanced combat system.  BUT, i hope other open world games (be it Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon, AC, etc) take notes that limited markers and bloated ""collection"" pieces are not necessary since consumers love mystery and freedom in their exploration.  On the other side, theres definitely some things From Software could do better.P.S.:  should add that audio design is still great.  Not the best 3D audio design but choice of music and sound effects are excellent.BUT the gameplay loop is definitely excellent and the game is the most accessible of all the Dark Souls.  Definitely worth a try.",1,4

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring is brilliant and one of the very best games I've ever played. Fans of FromSoft's previous games should absolutely NOT miss this one, and even fans who have never played a Soulslike should give it a try. Its massive open world sets new standards for depth &amp; detail and is simply filled to the brim with secrets to find, dungeons to explore, and foes to slay.

Combat is just as tough as in previous FromSoft games, but Elden Ring offers build variety and supportive mechanics that take some of the edge off of the harder bosses. The freedom to leave &amp; explore another area, instead of just banging your head against a single boss fight, really shakes up the FromSoft formula. I think this freedom will be one of the main factors that allows novices to ease into its style of gameplay.

At the time of writing I am currently experiencing occasional frame stutters, during which my FPS drops from a steady 60 to mid-40s. These typically occur in the Open World, when transitioning between areas of the map. I'm confident FromSoft will fix the issue with patches (no, not THAT Patches), and my experience with it simply isn't enough for me to not recommend Elden Ring to others. For reference, I am playing on an i7-10700KF with an RTX 3070 and 32 GB of RAM, with all settings turned to High and resolution at 1440.

The game is the culmination of the FromSoft formula and shouldn't be missed. Not saying that tech issues aren't important, but don't let it stop you from getting Elden Ring.",1,4
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Amazing game with so many implemented features from their previous games.
I have only played half of the game so far (it is so expansive!) and i have seen so many beautiful things. There was an underground city with a star system at one point.

The only negative reviews that i can understand and somewhat stand with would be the ones with the performance issues on pc, (didn't have issues with my ps5 so far). and i'm sorry for people who encountered save breaking bugs and stuff. it is very unlucky, and it is a thing that i'm sure fromsoft didn't want in their game... but in all honesty, save game issues have been in games ever since save data feature was introduced. (i had to replay rdr2 3 times cause my save data got corrupted on multiple occassions)
This game looks so pretty and calling it a ps3 is very stupid and demented.
also get your head out of the gutter, wanting a climbing system. just cause you don't know how to scale the environment, doesn't mean that everyone is brain dead as you and just wants to play uncharted/tombraider

it is a masterpiece overall, if you don't get the performance issues that some are having.

You really need to know your enemy's to beat them. Building the right skill set and finding fitting items is key for survival. The open world looks fantastic and it has lots of opportunity's for exploring. What should not be surprising, but sadly it is in these times. The game runs fairly well after release. I had no mayor issues or crashes. On my PS5 it runs a quite steady 60 fps, with sometimes a minor drop but it's hardly noticeable. Only the graphical assets could be tuned a bit. Sometimes you see textures like grass etc being rendered to sharper images.",1,4

The open world is big, but it doesn't invite you to explore and seems uninspiring and dull. Graphically, the game is quite okay but compared to other open world games again only average and not contemporary.

The gameplay can be described as follows:
You fight overpowered super agile enemies with ground gymnastics and stupid jumping around and get killed dozens of times.
How anyone can like this gameplay is beyond me.

The controls are garbage, a tutorial is completely missing, the interface is the total opposite of intuitive and you have to Google all the important information.

Small flaws cease to matter in the face of utter joy and serenity.",1,4
"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"The beste game from Miyazaki so far and it doesn't deserve this low user score.

given, this game (just like any other soulsborne game), is not intended to be liked by everyone. from software (or in particular Miyazaki) creates worlds where they establish their (oftentimes twisted) fantasies which happened to be liked by a small community. this community grew over the past years larger and larger (probably because more and more people got tired of plain guided 0815 story games) to a point, where elden ring created so much hype, that a lot of people from outside the community got sucked in.

so naturally, there are people that expected their standard game format and got not even closely to what they expected. no questlog, way too hard, no quick safe, blah blah blah...
but to complain about a game not being what you expected, even though you had no idea what you could expect from the franchise, is a bit hypocritical. that's like buying need for speed and complaining it's no race simulator like gran turismo.

so yeah, i think the critics score and the player score are both reasonable, but not fair.
the critics knew what was coming and reviewed it under known aspects of the franchise, while the user score results due to the mentioned misconceptions.

to me, this game is all i could have ever asked for. i love digging into the lore and trying to find out wtf is happening, as well as having to form a strategy to beat a boss, instead of just spamming my best move over and over (let's ignore the sword of night and flame for sec).
but i get it, people don't like it because it's not the casual entertainment you can relax to for an hour after work (or school), just coming down and not having to put too much time or brain in.

so in conclusion: the game doesn't deserve the negative feed-back it gets, but I can understand where it's coming from.
nonetheless, this is the best game from software has published so far! im already past 50+ hours into it and haven't even closely finished my first run.",1,4

The gameplay is similar to Dark Souls 3 with lots of additional features like jumping, horse riding, stamina breaking, crafting, sewing, and destructible environments for the many open world boss fights against giant enemies. Customization is great and derpy as you expect in a Fromsoftware game. The enemies are epic and horrifying with very interesting and creative looks and designs. It´s very challenging but you can always choose to further explore the open world than being stuck on a boss for hours.

There isn´t much story, it is the same obscure apocalyptic lore puzzle like in Dark Souls but the few npc quests are memorable and rewarding. Sound design and music are top notch.

The game runs at stable 60fps in performance mode with very few frame drops. Graphics aren´t as good as some PS5 exclusives but the art style and design of the open world and the enemies make more than up for that.

Overall a great game and the closest open world to Zelda BotW in terms of diversity and open world design. 10/10",1,4

Los gráficos son viejos, The Witcher 3 maneja gráficos similares y es un juego de 20152. El sigilo es pobre, la mecánica es nueva en estos juegos y se nota, ya que la inteligencia artificial de los enemigos que están pensando en hacerlos en sigilo es pobre, puedes pasar a la par sin que te vean mientras estés agachado y si ven un cadáver pasan totalmente de él lo que hace que los campamentos y algunas zonas de catacumbas se vuelvan relativamente sencillas3.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring, while retaining the spirit of Souls-like series, strongly reminds me of Morrowind. Not because of the open world, but because of the feeling of the unknown. When you see a monster - you have no idea how deadly it will be. When you see a place - you don't know what to expect and what you will find. When you explore the wilderness - you don't know whether it is a location for your level or whether you have gone somewhere you are not supposed to be. Everything seems dangerous. Everything seems exciting. Everything seems new.

That aside, it is very much a FromSoftware game - hard, punishing, rewarding. In many aspects, it is very similar to the Dark Souls series with some interesting twists on it and a lot of quality of life improvements around the multiplayer experience (which worked from day 1, how cool is that?).

Graphics... as many people rightfully complained, it is not something you would expect from a PS5 game and in some sense it is even losing to Dark Souls 3.

Also the sheer quality of the bosses.I think I’m in love But you’ve already read lots of praises so let’s talk about the downsides of the game. So far it’s optimization is not perfect on ps5(I hear it’s a lot worse on pc) but I am sure it will be fixed. I don’t get people who give bad ratings to the game just because it stutters. Jeez it’s been two days until release ,have some patience. It’s graphics are mediocre for a GOTY contender. I’d give it 6/10 or 7/10 . TBH i didn’t really expect this game to be the best looking game, but it doesn’t by any means look bad. People saying it looks like a ps3 game are simply ridiculous.The part that left me with a sour taste in my mouth( I wouldn’t say dissapointed because I already suspected it might be this way)  is that it didn’t really bring too many changes on the previous combat sytems of the game. I would be nice if the combat  had more touches of sekiro and bloodborne,not just dark souls, and also add the three types of dodging( rolling like dark souls,sidestepping like sekiro and dashing like bloodborne) and make them depend on equip burden and armorThe combat system is still a masterpiece ,but maybe it’s mechanics are perhaps a bit,old?Otherwise the world is great , the bosses are masterpieces and the combat system is still fun and addictive and the lore is fabulous.",1,4

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden is probably if not definitely the best game produced by FromSoftware and possibly one of the best games of all time. The content is vast and worth the money but for those not prepared for the challenges that come with the game, I would not recommend it as it takes some effort and learning to beat the game. However, while the game can be extremely difficult at times the game provides ways and means to overcome  these difficulties without holding the players hands through every step.

While the graphics are almost the same as ps4, everything else in the game compensates for it. The world is huge full of sites not usually found in any other game as the world feels built from scratch and the environment is specially built based on that. While the world is huge, it is not littered with meaningless quests and areas which makes almost every discovery meaningful and not like a chore.

While battling on horseback need a bit of getting used to and learning, the overall horseback mechanics are almost excellent and smooth without it feeling too clunky or restrictive.

The game is excellent and challenging with a vast open world and content that feels like it never runs out but does not feel like a chore hence continues to give a sense of adventure from the beginning to the very end of the game.",1,4

They denied the refund stating that ""the game has been downloaded so refund is not possible"". Well of course the game has been downloaded, that's how I came to know that it does not support English!!

I was expecting them to take SOME of the souls stuff and make this sprawling rpg with an amazing story and add some new mechanics to the mix it being 2022. But holy hell. Fighting is clunky there is no sprint that i can find. if an enemy is in my face and i use a spell it goes right through them....I get that it's hard and you die a lot and its supposed to be difficult. I could look past that IF my characters animations weren't ps3 era garbage. Why is that when the bosses look amazing? The graphics are awful.

"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,4,"After 80 hours I enjoyed the challenge of this game but aside from the graphics this game has nothing new to offer. The story line is weak the characters have zero development and the world becomes boring after awhile. I thought this was going to a MMORPG type of game but found the game to be extremely lonely, and not only is there zero NPCs but pretty much all the enemies are the same everywhere you go. Armor Sets are ugly some people will say they're cool but running around in ghoul armor isn't really for me. IDK if you like to cuss out your TV after dying for 6 hours straight and then find a brief moment of victory is your thing then this game is for you. I'm going back to Cyberpunk 2077 and will hope that AC Dawn Of Ragnarok will be better than it's previous DLC content.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Masterpiece. I was not sure if Souls formula was going to work in open-world but From absolutely nailed it. Exploration is super rewarding with secrets and bosses almost everywhere.,5,21
"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Amazing game, I started off somewhat skeptical when I was first exploring the map thinking it was empty, but when I started really exploring I realised how much caves, dungeons and secrets are all hidden and waiting to be discovered. It takes the mechanics and gameplay of each from game and puts them all together and it works. Combat feels great especially when you start finding new arts of war, combined that with spells and the new mounted combat and jump attacks. It took me a slight adjustment period but I'm hooked. The world is huge and full of loot. The trademark atmosphere that's from soft games are known for is here which is impressive given the open world format. I'd highly recommend to anyone especially a fan of dark souls.
Great universe and level design, creepy and interesting enemies and enemy encounters, exploration is rewarding and amazing and combat feels really good and very responsive.
Maybe I'm gonna sound ludicrous, but as soon as I got to the open world (which happens pretty fast). Feels great! That sensation that there's is a vast world to explore and you don't know what you're going to find and how many times you're gonna get into trouble. This is a kust play gane for any Souls game lovers!!!
Absolutely phenomenal. I think it's the freedom to get better and then come back to bosses when you are ready that attracts me. I have just walked out into the world, and wow, mind blown.
Soulsborne games are not somethin u can get straight away and they mostly take patience, clearly everyone heard about the hype but didn’t bother to research. They have their own genre because they are niche, they were never meant for everyone.
Any one who leaves a 1 star couldn’t get past the solider of godric in the tutorial or prolly didn’t even kno u had to jump down.
Enjoy it at ur own pace, the thing that is great about these games is everyone enjoys them in different ways.
And just anyone who respects beautiful games with heart and soul put into them.
This game is exactly what i was craving!!!  Love it.
The story is very engaging and the battles are tough and take time to master like other soulsbourne games. FromSoftware has done it again. A must try game.
Miyazaki went beyond anything the Elden Ring community imagined with this absolute masterpiece. He surpassed all expectations by bringing some of the most innovative of ideas, hence again revolutionising game design. ELDEN RING IS A TRUE MASTERPIECE! Tolga Özruh",4,17

The difficulty is sometimes absurd, and the level-design still... Well, I would say really weird (to not say bad).

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"Weakest Souls game in the series. I'm a huge fan of the prior games with 1000+ hours played and the empty open world, uninteresting boss fights and frame rate drops are unacceptable. The story feels like they replaced the nouns everywhere to re-theme it to 'Grace' and 'Tarnished' instead of 'Bonfire' and 'Ashen One/Chosen Undead' but forgot to make it feel meaningful. I was hoping for what Fromsoft had promised, a departure from the Souls series but this is Dark Souls 3 with a thin coat of paint covering an empty open world. Games like these are hard to develop and are huge financial risks to create, so I respect the work the team did to make this game as good as they could however they have ignored a lot of game design advancements in the industry that would have made a huge difference in making this feel worth my time. I really wanted to love this game and embrace whatever new things they wanted to do, shame what resulted.",2,9

If you had, why are you crying?From  made the best possible mix they could from ds and open world rpgs qnd guess what: best game for a long time.10/10 And GOTY for meAlso  @GamingisDying is q looser",2,10
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,A game should not be considered good simply because it's challenging. A game is still supposed to be a game and this is barely that. It gives u the most barebones pieces of information on what to do or where to go and tries very little to get u invested in the story or characters at all. It doesn't make u feel connected to your character or the world that you're in as it just throws you into a random location for you to run around and figure it out (which I've come to learn is the usual for souls games). And that's where another prblm comes for me and confuses me about all of these 10/10s. This is pretty much the same as all souls games just a way bigger open world to explore...but every game has a big open world nowadays so I don't get why this is such a selling point to have different places that u can explore. I can understand getting tired of following a bunch of markers with a crowded HUD and map of icons but most games allow the option to turn this down. It seems like this game is being rewarded for a tremendous lack of effort and its being disguised as groundbreaking. Which brings me to my next point. The lack of options in 2022 is unforgivable. This game assumes that you've played souls games before and judging by the reviews im guessing most reviewers have which I suppose explains the high rating a bit more. If you're a new player like me and countless other normal people it is nearly impossible to go into this game as is without a friend or some sort of guide to help you figure out the most basics of things like where youre even supposed to go. Playing with friends is also a chore as the system that's implemented is a hassle making it almost not even worth it when everytime you or the host dies you immediately return to your world. There's no option to spectate even for a few moments while returning you just immediately go back. Along with having to find/ buy materials to use everytime you want to play with a friend makes it almost not worth using. Why not have a system where you can at least craft a permanent tool to use to transport you to and from a friends world? Along with having stronger ones that allow you to be revived or die more than once or at least be able to spectate your friend after you die? Again seems like they were cutting corners and are being rewarded for it. All in all it kinda sucks at this games lack of effort in being an actual game because it does seem to have a great world to explore and be in with cool enemies to fight. However my personal preference for games is to be entertained and have fun not be constantly frustrated for hours for a few moments of joy. I would give it a higher score but the absolute horrendous overhype of this game and the fact that all reviewers are ignoring the glaring problems and turning them into benefits causes me to have give this a zero. I pray this doesn't beat out genuinely good games with compelling stories and characters at the any awards but sadly I know it will and it's honestly a shame. A shame they will be rewarded for a lack of effort. Giving more options to newer players wouldn't hurt core souls fans but would require work on the developer...they obviously didn't want tht.,2,10

Let me explain.Im a huge fromsoft fan and trust only them for day 1 preorders. I've platinumed all their games.  Buy It really worries me that blupoint demon souls remaster can launch at 4k 60fps or near to it but elden ring can barely hit 30fps and often dips as low as 15 in sadly the areas where you need consistent performance.  I bought a ps5 for improved graphics but all I get is decade old issues which on pc ive left behind with a 3080 though I've Elden ring runs worse on a 3080 than on a ps5 lolThere is a whiff of cyberpunk about the game where fans are blindly supporting and conveniently ignoring the serious technical issues which also include a few progression stopping glitches / bugs and the occasional game breaking issue.And post launch the patches are not addressing these issues. It still looks and runs like a...ps3 gen era game but tlou was ps3 and that ran and looked far better so...elden ring just looks ugly.  Great art design but everything else is far from the beauty of sekiro or the grandeur of bloodborne.The open world simply fails in 2022. If it was 2010 then I'm sure it be far more impressive as it has 2010 graphics. It's not remotely as good as botw or rdr2 which are games that existed before ER development even started. The latter alone is worrying  but the large empty space which witcher 3 dlc would laugh at...isnt much fun to play. Yes You can explore but you'll only find Skyrim like identical copy and paste areas. Forget the wildlife of most open world games or npcs with compelling stories.The George Martin element is inexplicably non existent making the game effectively a dark souls 4. The latter isn't a bad thing but it's not as good as ds3 in visuals / performance or gameplay so where does this leave us?The game isn't suitable for noobs or non fromsoft fans. It's a game seemingly more for fan boys, compromised journalists and shills to scream ""goty!"" while they wait for gameplay saving 'Patches' (sorry ;). It's not a bad game by any means but it has bad aspects to it or lazy maybe.  Bloodborne launched in a rough state so this is nothing new but it's still not acceptable.Wait for a sale a year from now when it's been fully patched.

Not to mention the performence issues like texture pop in, frame rate dips, and worst of all it doesn't save properly. The more I play the more it feels like Dark Souls. They say you can avoid bosses but after a while you run out of optional bosses and you gotta keep fighting the main bosses which are OP in most cases. Where as the dungeon bosses are a complete joke.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"I would love to play and review this game but as of 28th February 2022 the game is unplayable.

I am in Thailand and bought the pre-order of Elden Ring on PS4. I downloaded it and when I played the game, I found that the game was in ""Mainland Chinese Language"". No problem, I can change the language to ""English"". I was suprised that I could not do that. The game is only available in Chinese, Korean and Thai.

What? What happened?

In the SEA Region, the game has a ""Region Lock"" on its languages. This is not a Elden Ring problem but this is a Sony problem that affects Elden Ring gameplay.

The only way I can play an english version of this game is to buy the game (again) on a US PSN account and then play it in my asian account. I do not desire to buy the game again when the game I did buy works perfectly fine (except the language lock).

This is 2022, games should have an english language option no matter the region.

The exploration in this game is so good. I've never played anything to this level.

"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"10/10 for the anti-shills review bombing this game over petty issues (thanks guys and gals.....for totally and completely contaminating the user review process to the point that it is utterly pointless and utterly useless) that are far and away outshined by absolutely epic Souls-style gameplay, hide and seek open world design with quests that must be uncovered to be discovered and followed through to completion, intelligent diversification of the previously at times claustrophobic interlace corridor layout of prior Souls games, into one of the most unique and satisfying open world experiences ever crafted.  User reviewers who are dropping 0's, 1's, 2's, 3's , 4's have completely lost perspective....and worse, think they're being honorable in doing so.  Quite the opposite, in fact. As for the minor graphical/performance hiccups....the age old adage ""gameplay trumps graphics"" is absolutely hammered home in Elden Ring.  And, in spite of the ridiculously low scores trying to prove a point not worth proving, the graphics are very good.  They aren't ""the best""...it's not Ghosts of Tsushima....but they are good.  But any Souls player worth his or her salt, won't care about Ghosts style/level graphics/performance.  That's never been what these games are about.  It's about the art style.....the cryptic lore.....the fantastical dark fantasy elements and entities that are straight out of a Salvador Dali fever dream.  It's about the build and the weapons and the magic....for a world beyond one's conception.  For those of us Souls lovers who have also been pining for something.....anything....to bring in something fresh and challenging into the worn and thread-bare open world quasi-RPG adventure game genre.....Elden Ring is a colossal, shining-with-dark-light beacon.....a colossal, over-arching gold-white tree......to orient oneself around, wherever one might  travel looking for hidden wonders in this perennially and compulsively wonderful and extremely dangerous world.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"As an older player (the big 50) who has put countless hours into Demon Souls, Darks Souls Remastered and Dark Souls 3 and who considers Dark Souls 3 to be my favourite game of all time I have to say after about 20 hours into Elden Ring that this game is highly likely to claim the throne from Dark Souls 3. I appreciate if you are not into the Souls series as much as me you may want to come on here and give it a negative review especially if you are new to having a game not hold your hand and funnel you down a map full of quests in a logical order. This game expects you to be brave, explore, die (many times) and learn. It is not a game for some but, unlike being burnt by professional reviewers in the past for games such as Cyberpunk I can confirm they are spot on with their reviews for Elden Ring. This is a game changer for the Souls series and my definite GOTY unless I get blindsided by something else truly amazing though I highly doubt that is likely to happen. Anyway, a perfect 10 from me and just ignore the haters who probably played for a few hours and dismissed the game because the systems are purposely not as  intuitive as mainstream games and they got their asses beaten before rage quitting. The only negatives are perhaps the frame rate issues I experienced on PC but on the console, I'm very happy with it and I'm sure there will still be patches there in time. Certainly no major bugs like other open world games on release.... I think FromSoftware have released an amazing well polished product that I'm sure will only get better with time... other developers should take note!",0,3

"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I know 20 hours is not that much game time considering the biggest soulslike game to date, but even so I was able to explore, and die a lot. I started with the Samurai Class thinking I could be like the Starving wolf from Sekiro, but man i was wrong... I had my ass whooped, but the problem was not the game it was my mind set.
I got frustrated and decided to start all over as Vagabond and changed the play style to the one I used back in 2009 with my soldier class in Demon's Souls, ho boy, what a  difference, I rearranged my equip and my weapons to a melee play style based on strength and I was able to smooth the things up.
So if you are struggling, don't be ashamed in starting over with a new class, Elden ring brought to Soulslike genre all we needed in past games, it's less punishing but that doesn't mean it's easier, some enemies and bosses are quite challenging but very satisfying when once overcame. I haven't  had any performance issues or bugs so far, only some render delays but nothing much. Overall it's a great game, maybe a new starting point for the Soulslike genre, a sample of what Fromsoftware can provide from now on, and this is something interesting about them they know how to balance between new and old ideas. This is the passion we need from more devs. For newcomers keeping up, it might be a game that suits you, if it still doesn't, well let it go!",0,2

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Absolute masterpiece. If you have played and liked any souls game this is the magnum opus. If you have never, then you are in for a treat. Not a game that holds your hand but rewards you deeply.",0,1
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Before getting started, let it be known that I have played every FromSoftware game since Demon's Souls. I did not play King's Field or Armored Core. So in this review, when I am talking about the Soulsborne series, know it begins with Demon's Souls and ends with Sekiro.

I was saddened when Miyazaki said he wouldn't be making any more games in the Dark Souls franchise. From Demon's Souls to Dark Souls 3, I felt that these games were just fantastic. I loved going in and out of different areas, using different builds, summoning other players/NPCs, and even doing a spot of PvP. I didn't know how I would move on not being able to play such a great series.

Fast forward a little to Sekiro. I have not beaten Sekiro, but I do enjoy it. It is still installed, and I give it a shot every few weeks. The main issue with that game, or mainly myself, is that I am simply not good at parrying. Sekiro requires A LOT of parrying. That is not to say that it is a bad game by any means. Eventually, I will overcome the challenge of beating it. Still, it definitely did not bring me in like Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 3 did.

Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 are by far two of my favorite games to come out on PS4. I think I went through the entire system's life cycle with both of those games still installed to this day. People do their own prerogative with their money, but these games are not meant for one-time play-throughs. I encourage players to play through them even today with a different build than before and explore what these games really have to offer. Because that is where the love for these games lie.

Now we move to Friday, February 25th, 2022. I did not know what to expect from Elden Ring. After being out of the FromSoftware games for a while now, since I did not play a lot of Sekiro, I was skeptical of even buying it on day one. As the release day got closer, I would see new videos showing what the game had to offer. I started to see a resemblance to Dark Souls 3, giving me the go-ahead to pick it up and play another Soulsborne game. I am glad I did this very thing.

I didn't know how they would put a Soulsborne game into an open-world genre, but man, have they delivered. FromSoftware shows gamers that they can make an excellent, open, and unending game set in this genre. Reading the tutorial messages on the ground and fighting the weak enemy battles through the tutorial zone, I was definitely back in the saddle again (settle down, Steven Tyler). You open the final door and are revealed the gloriousness of Limgrave.

Many reviews say this game looks like ""PS3 graphics"" or ""no accessibility"" for new players. I'm sorry, you must be new here. FromSoftware has always stuck to its guns on delivering challenging games. No one seemed to be this upset about Dark Souls 3 or Sekiro. Maybe this game had more hype than a usual FromSoftware game, but to say it is ""not welcoming to new players"" is such a waste of breath. All games are not made for everybody. For instance, Fortnite/Apex Legends are not accessible because every week, there is something new and garbage in my book. However, I am not going around making a big stink about it. The slogan, ""mad cause bad,"" definitely sticks here, and to review bomb something because you keep dying is not a good discussion for anyone.

Does Elden Ring have some flaws? Absolutely it does, but they have also doubled up on the quality of life things, like fast travel and the abundance of fast travel spots, or Sites of Grace. Do you know how nice it would have been to have a bonfire 10 steps from a boss door? Me neither.

Another complaint I am seeing is the lack of hidden secrets on corners of the map. I watched a video of a popular streamer rage at there not being something on the corner of a map. I don't recall Breath of the Wild or Skyrim doing that either. This is exploration in a nutshell. If you find something in every nook and cranny, then the items you do find are not going to be as worth it.

Am I biased to this series? Absolutely, but I call out bad things in games I enjoy too. I have not even started the PvP side of things yet. That could lead to the ""2-second"" lag that the PvP in these games has always had, which drives me nuts and is why I do not play it competitively. If you swing your weapons at me and roll, I shouldn't take damage from that swing two seconds later. We will see how that side of things plays out, as I won't dive into PvP until usually on my second play-through.

In summary, FromSoftware delivers on an open-world Soulsborne game, especially when many games coming out cannot capitalize on the open-world aspect.

It would be a 9 out of 10, but I found two greatswords and have dual-wielded them now, and that in itself is worth another point.

"Mar  9, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Probably the best souls game only gripe and it’s a minor one is the crafting system.

It’s a masterpiece that renders Dark Souls 2 &amp; 3 as somewhat redundant. Don’t expect fast-paced gameplay like Bloodborne and Sekiro; while Elden Ring retains some elements from those games, it’s ultimately about taking a careful and measured approach to combat. For those who loved Dark Souls for its sense of mystery and unparalleled loot, Elden Ring is unbelievably rich and diverse. I doubt any other RPGs exist with as many unique weapons, armor sets, spells, and abilities as Elden Ring. It cranks everything up to 11 and achieves the same level of excellence as From Soft’s greatest (Dark Soul 1, Bloodborne, Sekiro).",0,1

Art direction is dope as always, enemies are goddamn hell-nightmares as always, and this has some insanely cool looking boss fights. BOTW 2 better do something crazy because it's boutta feel DRY AS **** after Elden Ring. The existance of this game should yeet BOTW from every ""best of"" list from here on out.

This is the greatest adventure with REAL emotions I've ever played so far. It's gigantic and you will find the best of Dark Souls, Demon Souls, Bloodborne AND an living open world combined. If you seek out a true adventure, with all it's ups and downs you'll love it.

"Mar 16, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Phenomenal game. I've put over 200 Hours in it and still missed a couple questlines in the first playthrough. The Ashes of War system is great and the Power-Stancing returning is awesome. Can't wait to hop back in with new builds. Only thing I would have liked is a few NG+ changes like Dark Souls 2 had, but I understand it would be harder to implement in a game of this size. You could complain about some bosses being reused but from lore perspective it makes sense. Some bosses that are reused have different status effects and more moves, so it's not like they're all the exact same. Game looks great graphically for a cross-generation game. Of course it's not going to look quite as good as Demon's Souls Remake because that was designed specifically for the PS5 and Demon's Souls is split into separate areas, not one open world. No FPS issues in all of my time playing. Wish people wouldn't review bomb games. If a game isn't for you just accept that. Don't go around bashing games simply because they were too hard for you or not what you expected. Do some more research before you buy a game.

Not sure why so many reviews are saying terrible graphics, I am on the PS5 and think the graphics are stunning.

The open world is unique and nothing feels repetitive. Almost everywhere I go there is some crazy new boss, event, or strange scenario going on. The game does a good job at rewarding you for exploring places and has good general progression.

The combat. Lets be real, the combat is the bread and butter of souls games. Elden ring is no exception, they have fine tuned their formula with a few new interesting twists which makes for even more varied builds and great fights between all sorts of bosses.

This is the Magnum Opus of the souls series, definitely worth checking out.",0,1
"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Absolutly awesome. That's how an open world should be like. It's certainly a mix of BotW and Dark Souls. The horse combat is fantastic and well incorporated in the fighting. Couldn't recommend it more. I play on XSX and there are no issues at all. A bit of balancing needs to be done probably, spells seem so much better than incantations, but that's a minor issue.",0,2

Aunque tiene varios problemas, a veces me mareo porque el framerate no es ni de lejos estable, las físicas en el mundo son prácticamente nulas y la IA de los enemigos que me persiguen en masa me parece ridícula, la falta de doblaje por lo que siempre penalizo a los juegos.

Most of the negative reviews are from people who probably shouldn't be playing a game like this anyways and will whine about the difficulty or a few PC gamers with legit issues which are getting patched anyways. With all the buggy trash that has come out recently complaining about this game after Cyberpunk etc. feel like blasphemy to be honest.

If you don't like soulsborne the game may not be for you I'm not going to lie its tough but not impossible. I don't get the people comparing this to Horizon totally different games like apples and oranges I guess they came out in the same release window (shrugs).

I've been playing it fairly slow compared to others, it seems at 60 hours +7 on launch night before I re rolled my build. I want to savour it and I hope it never ends and by the looks of the full map that people keep spoiling on social media I'm less than half way through the game and even now I feel it is gigantic It never feels empty and every discovery is am organic, rewarding moment. It's still Souls combat with a tad more fluidity and the graphics aren't Sony level but in HDR it looks as pretty as Ghost of Tsushima at times. ....Agh, people on here have said it a million  times.

It can be tough and your heart will pound during encounters. Yet overcoming these obstacles surges the body with gratification. I’m playing on PC and I haven’t encountered any bugs. Graphics are great. Not outstanding but is that really negative? Everything seems polished and stylized it’s fantastic to gander at. There ARE slightly common frame drops in the open world though. Does that actually mean it deserves a 9? Or an 8? Does a couple frame drops really give a game a review bomb of zero? Seems a little steep for such a minor inconvenience. I have fun playing the game!

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"First off! enough with emotional review bombs from users who forgot that this type of games are for a selective player base and dose not appeal to the general public.IT IS A HARD GAME, get over it. in its core it is really a true souls like game with narrow levels with more paths to take to get forward. It also give u these huge areas for u to explore outside of that if u fell like the bosses get u a bit too hard. this is to get it to be easier for newer players.

the style of the graphics is so cool. i love how the art style makes up for the graphics overall. its not the most heavily graphical game u have ever played but the style and art in this game makes it as one of the most beautiful titles i have played for a long time. Good graphics don't need to be high polygon levels.. as many seem to think.

the combat feels amazing. never have i played every new weapon i got or tried its style as much as i did in this title. the bosses are a huge step up from former titles and it feels like the ai can really think of what u are going to do next.

sure this game has some few annoying things but if u can look past them and see the entire game as it is. I believe its the first 10/10 game in a long time.

the lore is more present in this game and the world comes more alive than ever before. they really smashed it out of the park with this one. its on my top 5 games of all time. right next to Witcher 3 and that's saying something,

what I have gathered is that ppl complain about it being to hard and not holding ur hand. but honestly I have been more engaged in a game for a long time. for from software to actually give that benefit of the doubt that the player can figure out where to go based on this games awesome level design and story bits make u really think how braindead and handhold other titles are now. let that sink in. I'm looking forward to see what from software brings to the table in the future as they just raised the bar so high,

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,At my opinion from software manage completely to make a open world soul game from another dimension.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is what happens when a Fromsoftware game goes mainstream, it gets review bombed. This is probably the most mainstream Fromsoft game to date, as I have many friends who have messaged me about the game who normally don't even consider these types of games. That's great, because I love seeing this community grow and many more people will be drawn into these games because of Elden Ring, but I don't think some people really understand what they are signing up for. I have about 40 hours into the game, and I can say that if you are a Fromsoft fan, this will be heaven. World is engaging and full of secrets, progression and builds feel personalized and unique, and the bosses are top tier quality. I personally have not experienced framerate drops, but I know that it is an issue for some players so keep that in mind. Everything about the game feels nearly perfect. The combat is fun, the world is engaging, and I've had a great time playing with some of my newer friends just messing around in The Lands Between. The only con (minor) I have of the game is the size of it can get confusing, which tbh is nothing new for a Fromsoft game, but because of Elden Ring's sheer size, at times I can go like an hour not finding anything and have to resort to a guide to figure out where to go. Overall this game is fantastic and deserves all of the praise (unless you are experiencing technical issues but those will be fixed). The main reason for the review bombs are new players coming into the game expecting it to be something like GTA with swords. It's not, it's a Fromsoft game. Stop crying about the first boss being too difficult and actually try to learn the fight. The first Fromsoft game you play will be your hardest, but thanks to how popular Elden Ring is, there will be more than enough people ready to help you on your journey. Trust me, if you are persistent enough, you will overcome the challenges of this game and feel like a badass, but hey if this style of game isn't for you, then it isn't for you. No harm done.

"Mar 17, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"It's fun and I have little complaints - 8 out of 10 is a bit reaching because of some performance issues and complete lack of story.

It's a game centered around boss fights, which are essentially puzzle games that require you to memorize a sequence of actions and learn through painstaking trial and error what works and what doesn't. More often than not, rushing to kill a boss by taking 2 stabs where you can only safely land 1 is what gets you killed.

If you are someone who can beat these types of bosses within the first couple attempts, then this game is for you.

If you are like me and die a ton of times, please be aware that the game is developed to give you a sense that you can improve your skills when all you are really doing is memorizing a rote pattern. So long as you understand this, you will enjoy the game.

Reaction time is something that can't be significantly improved beyond a really young age (a teenager is too old). In sports you can make up for this with physical fitness - you can't react any faster, but you can train your body to be faster - video games do not offer that counterbalance. This is something I really wish I knew when I was younger, and I really hope a lot of frustrated gamers out there see the light, stop falling for addiction traps like this game is centered around, and spend the saved time learning a valuable skill.",0,1

Agora falaremos da parte ruim do jogo, a performance no PS5 não é boa, é no máximo aceitável, é muito framedrop, os pop in de grama estão ABSURDOS e muito irritante.

The world is awesome and exploration feels so great that its on par with Red dead 2 or the witcher 3.

"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"For anyone wondering about whether or not they might enjoy Elden Ring, I believe that it is important to say that Elden Ring is only slightly more accessible than most of its Dark Souls predecessors. This is still very much a challenging video game that prioritizes strategic, skill-paced combat, and does not hold your hand. It is centred around traversing a fantasy world full of grim and grotesque enemies, and its story is mostly told in vague snippets of lore. These offerings are not meant as criticisms - they are simply statements about what one who has never played a FromSoft Dark Souls-style game might expect from this game.

For my part, I can comfortably say that this is one of the most deeply engrossing, comfortably challenging and overall awe-inspiring video game experiences I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Some areas of the game definitely possess that old-school, claustrophobic feel of the Dark Souls games, and bring back those narrow corridors with enemy distributions that feel sadistic - however, there are also numerous wide-open spaces filled with breathtaking views, where you can also accidentally run right into an extremely intimidating boss that could easily overwhelm you.

Can I recommend this game to everyone? Absolutely not - it's a Souls game, through and through. It is not the colourful, easily accessible romp through a colourful, hooking world that games like Minecraft, Fortnite or Mario might offer. But this is a game that, even after the 150+ hours I have clocked playing it, still provides excitement, a sense of discovery, and an astonishing amount of opportunities to experiment when it comes to fighting enemies.

Elden Ring is somewhat obtuse, challenging (sometimes shockingly so) and will not hold your hand. However, it is also an undeniably incredible video game that could easily provide you with well over 1000 hours of enjoyment. This is a no-brainer for anyone who ever enjoyed a Souls game, but also offers new players a chance (the most of any game of its kind, but still not much of one) to experience their first Souls game. Elden Ring might not be for everyone, but anyone who ends up enjoying it is almost certainly going to absolutely love it.",0,2

Ojo, no digo que esto sea un caso Cyberpunk ni mucho menos, este es un juego muy disfrutable, sobretodo si eres fan de la conocida saga Souls.

Yo lo soy, desde sus inicios, y así como vi la creación de una leyenda del videojuego con unos cimientos mega solidos y una cumbre tan alta como el Everest en Bloodborne y Dark Souls 3, he visto su declive absoluto, acompañado de la misma propaganda periodística que bailó las aguas del declive de Blizzard, en Sekiro y sobretodo en este videojuego.

Miyazaki se está quedando sin ideas, y lo peor es que la unica solución que ha encontrado es volver a usar como referencia la saga Zelda, pero con el peor The Legend of Zelda que existe hasta la fecha, el Breath of the wild.

Yo aun confio en Miyazaki, y volveré a estar ahí en su próximo videojuego, pero espero que ignore la burbuja mediática que está viviendo y vuelva a su sendero. No quiero que una de mis compañias favoritas se convierta en la nueva Blizzard.",0,1

This game is a culmination of everything fromsoft has learned over theirs years in making games and it is an absolute landmark achievement. The sheer amount of content in this game is incredible. I have been playing for 25 hours and have only begun to scratch the surface. The artist direction is phenomenal. All of the new mechanics and quality of life improvements that fromsoft has added are welcome additions! Do NOT be fooled by the bad reviews. These are people that are upset that it has yet to be optimized as well for PC. Yes, it does run into problems on PC at times. This does not make it anything less than what it is. The developers are aware of the problem and are working on a patch. Japanese games are often less optimized on PC.This game is definitely more accessible than other souls titles but still expect it to be very challenging at the least, and at most VERY difficult.I still recommend this game to anyone who loves great action or JRPGs, as you would be hard pressed to find a better game in those categories.",0,1

Character are really good and the gameplay is fun to. Is a lot similar to dark soul but trust me, if you don’t use the new mechanics you will be punished a lot, the game is balance around the new stuff.

"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"DISCLAIMER: At the time of writing this review, the S.E.A. copies of the game for console are still locked to a single language, predominantly Chinese. As a Canadian living in Japan, my copy is locked to Japanese, which is greatly reducing my potential enjoyment of the game. That said, my minor Japanese knowledge and experience with previous Souls titles has allowed me to play regardless. I'm holding onto hope that the Elden Ring team or Bandai Namco Games will be able to add a patch or a DLC Language pack, but until that time I CANNOT recommend this game for any foreign residents living in Asia unless you are familiar with Chinese (or Japanese in Japan).

I was worried going into this game that the open world would detract from the thing I love most about Dark Souls: The intricately crafted level design and meticulously planned out world/player experience. In some aspects, it does, but I think the open world adds a lot more to the game than it detracts. The intricate level design and the experiences are still there in spades for the players, but with the added benefit of ramping up the exploration aspects to 11.

I also think it improves the accessibility of the franchise. If a boss/area is too difficult, there are dozens of other bosses and areas to go take on or explore. In previous series, you would have a few options, but if none of them were viable to you then you either wasted time grinding or quit. Just by exploring more of the rich and fantastical world that Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin have brought to life, players can get stronger while discovering secrets, powerful abilities and unique equipment.

There are also a lot of new abilities and quality of life improvements added to Elden Ring such as summon spirits and ashes of war. It's virtually a guarantee that any player will be able to conquer any of the challenges that Elden Ring sets before them with enough ingenuity, planning and exploration.

I would highly recommend this game to any fans of previous ""Souls/Borne"" titles, people who like exploration, people who enjoy challenging gameplay, and fans of open world games (who don't mind a larger-than-typical challenge of other open world games as there is no quest log and few map markers to speak of).",0,2

I will say, the world building is amazing and crazy how much there is going in it. The art looks amazing and one of the best looking games I've seen. So artists for the game should feel proud.

Beyond that the game just sucks and people really think it's amazing only because they are so distracted by pretty graphics they ignore poorly balancing and bugs. Sadly the game when working perfect isn't even that horribly difficult. The majority of the times I've lost to a boss and I didn't dodge the wrong way or something is because they glitch out. This goes both ways to, some are to easy because of the bugs. One of the first little dungeons I went in the boss wouldn't even move no matter how many times I reset it so had to just kill it and move on without even fighting it. Today trying the first big story boss and his dragon arm grabbed me multiple times when I wasn't even by him. He picked me up but I was floating in the air over 10 feet from him and killed me. Of course the game is hard when bosses don't work right. The bosses that don't bug out are usually a challenge but most of the time I win after only a few try's at most.

As far as difficulty goes, it just pisses me off when my girlfriend would love to play the game and see the world they crated and enjoy the story. But she can't because they think only elite gamers should be allowed to play it. She just isn't that good at this kind of game no matter how hard she try's and can never play the game because of that. I'm sorry, but to me that's just being a bunch of stuck up **** who think to highly of themselves.

Plus, any dev launching a game on PC with that many bugs doesn't deserver any praise.",0,1

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is Miyazaki's magnum opus. Without question. I went into this game with very high expectations, and the reality still managed to blow me away. I haven't played an open world game this content-rich, with this much depth, since either Skyrim or Witcher 3. The world is so vast, there's secrets around every corner. Every zone has multiple sub-zones that you don't even know are there until you stumble onto them. There's even MASSIVE subterranean zones underneath the land's between that you don't even know exist until you find them. There's no invisible walls or plot devices that block your exploration. If you see something that looks cool in the distance, you CAN go there and explore it whenever you want, as long as you can survive the trek to it. The world building at work here, thanks in large part to George R.R Martin's input, is unbelievable and EXTREMELY refreshing to see in a FromSoftware title.

Elden Ring feels like a slap in the face to the current game-design dogma that is plaguing the consumer base, where developers rush out half-finished titles lacking in content, only to properly finish the game later with paid DLC. I have put over 80 hours into Elden Ring so far, and I still haven't seen the credits. Seriously, there hasn't been a game that's taken me this long to finish, thanks to how content-rich it is, in over a decade. Easily GOTY material, depending on how good GoW:Ragnarok is. One of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. If you like the souls games, you owe it to yourself to experience Elden Ring. Even if you've only dabbled a bit into them before, you owe yourself a chance to experience it.",0,1

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,4,"This game would've been truly amazing had they added true co-op and abandoned the Darks Souls co-op system. A lot of people have been wanting a decent fantasy coop experience for years, and Elden Ring made it seem like it was going to be the first to do one right, but the co-op system is horrendous. They make you jump through pointless hoops than actually making the game harder. You'll be blocked by some magic fog wall, have to kick your friend out, walk five feet into the cave and summon them back in. I was highly annoyed by that, but what really got me, was the fact that they block co-op altogether in a region after defeating the region boss. Co-op was a selling point for me when I bought this game, but the devs didn't bother to mention all of these restrictions. Most of the elitists will say, ""but co-op makes the game easier, and that's bad."" Well, all ya gotta do is make the enemies tougher. There, fixed. The way they implemented the co-op seem like the devs have some personal vendetta against people who want to play with their friends. It's an open-world game, and ya'll should adapt to that. The game has the potential to be the best fantasy game since Witcher 3 came out. If they fix this ridiculous co-op system, I will give this game the highest rating possible.",0,3

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"I'm 30 hours into the game and it is fantastic.  It is challenging, yes, but Elden Ring gives you more options than previous FromSoft games for mitigating that difficulty - from just going off and exploring another part of the world until you feel ready to tackle the challenge, to summoning 'spirits' that aid you in difficult fights.

The world is gorgeous, the enemies are well-designed, there are tons of great weapons and spells to play with, and when you reach a 'dungeon' area, it is laid out like the best classic Souls locations.  The second dungeon area, (the Academy) plays like a perfect melding of Yharnam from Bloodborne and Irythil from Dark Souls 3.

There are a few *minor* technical problems with the PC version on launch.  People giving this game 0 out of 10 because it doesn't support ultrawide monitors are just being ridiculous.  There's a bit of minor frame stuttering when the game loads new assets, but this only happens occasionally and never during combat encounters, and i've encountered a few minor bugs, but none were game-breaking and I expect all to be ironed out in patches within the next month or so.

I'm 30 hours in and I feel like I'm maybe 1/3 of the way through the game.  It's breathtaking in scope and incredibly fun to play.  I'm giving it a 9 rather than a 10 because the open world does sometimes feel a bit less unique than previous From games - it is definitely influenced by BOTW and Skyrim - and because of those minor technical hiccups.  But absolutely fantastic game and a must-play.",0,1
"Mar 15, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,"Definetly the worst game from the soul series, as it even gets to be called a ""soul series game"" even though it pretends (or was marketed pretending to) be something new and different. It is not. The game is a poor mixture of Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne and Sekiro. It's absolutely generic, as it copies infinite secondary and mini-bosses from the previous games. The game is an eternal liop in a poor open word, boring and repetitive, with no plot (contrary to what was sold, using the name of George R. R. Martin). After all that, graphics were far better on Demon Souls. Even still, the game struggles to load scenarios, hardly runs smooth on 60 fps using the performance mode and has a lot of issues. For example, I had one boss, wich was so generic I can't remind his name, being sanding still at his final 10% of life waiting for me to put him out of misery (wich was probably being a part of this game). Never seen such an overrated game. I only recomend it if you are in for some dark souls copied gameplay, wich may be fun. Don't expect more than that.",0,1
"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"As a Dark Souls fan, this game is amazing. Very large open world, beautiful graphics, and they did a great job making it more user friendly to new players. It still has a Dark Souls challenge to it, but they provide you with a map, and the tools you need to succeed. With it being open world, if you are struggling, just go somewhere else until your stronger. Lots of weapons and armor, spells, and awesome enemies. This game is a for sure 10/10 for me. Finally a game that seemed finished on release, rather than waiting for updates to make it fun.",0,1
"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,It’s addicting and yes it’s challenging.  You need to put some hours in this game and explore the world to level up your character and the game gets better and better the longer you play.,0,2
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Melee and mounted combat are almost perfect! The world is gorgeous and the game runs well. It needs a bit of tuning due to some drops in frame rate but it does not change the fact that this game is Awesome!,0,1
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"For me it is already the game of the year and one of the best games I have ever played. The open world feels completely different from anything you've ever played before - but better. Nowhere do annoying quest markers or arrows take you by the hand and guide you through the world as if on rails. Everything you can find has a purpose or is meaningful. There is no trivial collection stuff. The best part is the sense of openness. You see something in the distance and wonder ""How do I get there?"". Then you try for a while and don't make it. Do something else and then end up at said place 5 hours later. I've really played a lot of open world games. But this open world is a kind of opus magnum. Future open worlds will have to measure up to this.It's big Dark Souls, but in a good way.",0,2

"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"The best open world game since Skyrim. With a world so densely packed with amazing gameplay and lore it is very deserving of all the critical acclaim it has received thus far. Elden Ring is a game that takes all the greatness of previous From Software games and adds quality of life changes so any gamer can play it. This game is being review bombed by users on here due to the difficulty and to them I just have to say, watch gameplay of a game before you spend $60 on it. While I personally don’t think the game is any harder than something like cup head or shovel knight, like those games it takes trial and error to succeed. If you want something easy and pretty play Horizon. If you still wanna give elden ring a shot but are unsure about the difficulty know that you can always summon help or grind in other areas. Something most angry consumers never even attempted.",0,4
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,Was fun at the start when everything seemed more balanced and all builds were doable. But as you get late in the game you're forced to use certain elements and playstyles. Magic isn't nearly as good as in the other souls games. Game has dozens of spells but only a few are good to use the entire game.Co-op is a joke. Both the host and spirit people have their damage and vials reduced by half. Game doesn't give any reason to do co-op other than to play with friends. Game is a lot about exoring and learning to mark on the map where to come back layer to due to being a lower level than what the game expects in areas. I explored and killed all bosses I found and got to the final boss. This game is a joke compared to  other souls  games.,0,2

The Atmosphere is very unique and the world ingame design reminds me a lot of Zelda BOTW, which I fairly liked a lot too.

"Mar 15, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Love this game and a big fromsoftware fan. It's not to every one's taste tho. It's tough and doesn't hold your hand.

"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"This game in my opinion has lived up to it's expectations. I love how challenging the boss is, especially Margit, the first boss you fight who is harder than what a first boss should be but i think that is perfectly fine as it sets the tone for this game. What's different about this game compared to other souls game is that if you can not beat a boss, you are able to explore to find stronger items and power up your stuff. My issue with the game however is that I've often encountered a bug that makes you stuck midair when you try to summon your horse. It has caused me to lose many runes required to level up and made me restart boss fights like Radahn. For people saying this game has no story, empty open world, or unfair boss fights are just wrong imo. The game does have a story but it is not told traditionally like other games, From Soft's approach with these story telling is giving players bits of pieces for you to think about it and piece them yourself. The open world aspect of this game is done right, in every region you explore, there are ALWAYS caves, dungeons, and towers to explore for loot. You're not always running around in an empty area as there is always something to reward you. The bosses in this game is hard but i don't think they are unfair. This game is a souls game at heart and requires you to learn the bosses animations/attack patterns to perfectly dodge. Some bosses punish you heavily for spam rolling, which is perfectly fine. Overall i really recommend this game. It is the best game to get into the souls series as it allows you to explore to get stronger.",0,1

"Mar 18, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,8,"+ The lore , world building , characters are still really cool and mysterious
+ There's still a ton of builds you can make and experiment with adding to the replayability
+ Some extremely cool looking locations
+ The occasional great boss fight
+ Dynamic weather is really nice . I love it when it starts to rain out of nowhere
+ Better checkpoints before boss fights (For the most part)
- Even by Souls standards the story is really incoherent
- Too many asset flip side bosses and dungeons which is a by product of the world being needlessly huge
- Progression is slow to incentive you to explore but because of the above it gets really tiresome and repetitive fast so thank god for exploits
- Many times the difficulty corelates to what a cheap jumpscare does for a horror game . It gets the job done but it's artificial (Bosses spazzing out , aim bot , gank squads , one shots etc.)
- Jankiness , input delay , poor clipping and bad camera during large scale boss fights
- Frustrating without a guide especially when it comes to quests and knowing where items are
- Too dependent on farming , meta items and ashes of war to carry you . This was true in past games as well but it never felt like a requirement

In both a positive and negative way Elden Ring did nothing that I did not expect and unsurprisingly people twist the games negatives into positives like they always tend to do . It also suffers from the exact same issues Dark Souls 2 did , the open world did nothing for me personally and in case you gave a rats ass no I don't consider Elden Ring to be a masterpiece but in a sea of garbage nowadays it sure appears like one",0,3

(Because of similarity i got platinum trophy nioh 1 And still continue nioh 2) Im have been looking forward to elden ring since its announcement. I think its fantastic. Ds with open world was our dream for years And its real now. A lot of people bought elden ring because of its popularity And hype. Most of them never play ds before. So they couldnt understand the game And its taste. Most important things are secrets  And discover something without help. Its critical for me. You have to look around, under every rock, every cave etc. I love it. Playing  With your friends is more enjoyable.Good game, have fun",0,4
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Subjectively, I understand how Elden Ring can be divisive...It's a punishing Soulsborne game that can beat players into the ground.  It's a game that's simply not for every gamer and I question just how much more ""accessible"" it really is.

Objectively, Elden Ring is the pinnacle of gaming and possibly one of the top 5 open world games ever made.  No, there aren't vast villages and towns with shops to explore littered throughout the world.  Instead, there are hidden NPC's, bosses, dungeons, enemy encampments, mines, abandoned churches, numerous areas, numerous secrets, etc.  It's very different from your ordinary open world fantasy game, but done in the best ways possible.

Ultimately, it's hard to find a ""weak point"" with Elden Ring, other than to say it won't appeal to many gamers.  I have not, for example experienced any of the technical issues, and everything else (as stated by other reviews) is perfect.  Gameplay is amazing and hitboxes are fixed.  Dungeons and Legacy Dungeons are brilliantly done.  The open world is varied and begs to be explored.  Bosses are difficult, but co-op is back and better than ever.  Customization is nigh infinite.

It is a brilliant game with brilliant pieces.  Although, one that not everyone will enjoy if they're not up for the adventure.",0,1
"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Even though its only my second FromSoftware game (1st was Bloodborne), I must say I'm absolutely thrilled about this game. The atmosphere, the gameplay, the audio and the size is totally 10/10.

Worth My Time: Yes, easily a 500+ hour game.
Worth My Money: Yes, you definitely get your money's worth.

What I Like: It's the souls formula in an open world and it works well. So if you enjoy both genres like me, then you're in for a treat. Mostly a familiar trek to those experienced, but adds just enough variety and new stuff to keep things interesting.

What I Dislike: It's a PS4 (PRO) game through and through. Nothing is being taken advantage of specifically in the PS5 hardware. In fact, the performance can be quite subpar at times. Magic is OP in both PVE and PVP in this game. Great if you like magic, sucks if you don't.

How It Stacks Up: I still prefer the Dark Souls series. This game does some great things, but it also falls short in some aspects. Assets are reused quite a bit, despite the core gameplay being addictive. PVP is in a bit of a sorry state right now unless you use magic. Difficulty is more forgiving due to lots of checkpoints and less severe death penalties, but the game is still long and treacherous. It's a must play.",0,1

The world is massive, intricate and really pulls off a dark fantasy atmosphere that I didn’t expect. Nearly every feature from all past “Soulsborne” games is implemented and improved. Combat is satisfying, character building is thorough and uniquely diverse. I’m currently over 20 hours in and am still finding new things at every corner. I have no doubt I will be playing this game for years. It’s important to mention to everyone who does not understand this style of game, you do not beat this type of game, you endure.

However, I feel everyone’s personal play through will be a little different and the anecdotes will be unique and entertaining. On my 3rd character, I was clearing an area that I had been through 2 times. I was happily gobbling up resources and poking around the map without a care in the world. All of the sudden, a boss health bar appears that says ‘Deathbird’. A giant skeletal crow about 20 times my size drops out of the sky and pecks me to death. I was slack jawed for a bit and then just started laughing. The thing scared the crap out of me and was pure nightmare fuel to look at. When I came back, it didn’t show up. It took me awhile to realize it was a nighttime boss only. I advanced time and after a few tries, got my revenge. I can’t think of another series where things like this happen.",0,2

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"This game is the most overhyped trash I ever played in my entire life! The frame rate is never stable on PS5, it doesn't have haptic feedback or adaptive triggers, and the graphics doesn't look anything special, games from two years ago like Ghost of Tsushima and even God of War from 2018 looks so much better,. The multiplayer system is the worst I ever encountered in a game, if the host or the guest dies , they both get disconnected, and you can't play with a friend for 2 minutes straight without getting invaded by someone who is extremely over leveled above you both, which in turn will kill you easily and get you disconnected again, totally not fun! The bosses in this game are poorly designed as well, there is always a spirit character that you can summon before the fight to use him as a distraction for the boss, while you are attacking him from the back over and over til it dies, not to mention you can also summon your own spirits to do more distraction for you, there is no ""gitting gud"" in this bull**** game, it's terribly designed and doesn't deserve 10/10 at all! Not even close! I would give it a 6/10 at best, but because I hated it so much I'll give it a 0/10, it's the worst most overhyped game I ever played, I regret buying it and if this is what is considered to be the new high standards in gaming, then the gaming industry is truly F*****! The combat in this game is also very cluncky, you can't cancel your animations once you pressed a button, and the dodge and run actions are mapped to the same button as well, it's just very cluncky controls and totally unnecessary! Save your money and do not buy this overrated garbage. The only positives I had in this game are the character creation system, and the world map is designed well, that's it!

"Mar 11, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Visuals: 9 - Audio: 8 - Fun: 9 - Longevity: N/A - Engagement: 9 - Overall Score: 9 (so far)
Only started playing 'Elden Ring' so I can only offer a 'Work in progress' review
'Elden Ring' is better looking than 'Dark Souls 3' but not as polished as the 'Demon's Souls' remake.
Music is typically rousing when combat takes place and calm / relaxing when roaming the world.
Controls are almost identical to previous 'Dark Souls' games but with a few new moves that really enhance gameplay.
'Elden Ring' is a 'Souls' game that has been inspired by 'Zelda: Breath of the Wild' which is an absolutely brilliant thing.
So far 'Elden Ring' feels more of an evolution rather than a revolution however I am really enjoying it and can totally recommend.",0,2

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Absolute masterpiece. I'm only 30 hours in and absolutely delighted with the world they created.

The only flaw I see? This game needs a warning on its cover: ""not another ubi-like game""

No, seriously, I'm so tired of games that constantly hold my hand and treat me like I'm a child. Unlike FarCry, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima, Assassins Creed and others, Elden Ring trust its players. Here you get to truly explore a world in ruins. It's a beautiful and mysterious land. You see a castle far away? An abandoned house? A cavern entrance? Maybe go take a look. And be sure you'll find a location that is so unique it doesn't need question marks or a compass pointing to it.

Same for the non-player characters and their quests. They also feel unique and tailored to be memorable. Not the traditional ""fetch x pieces of wood"", ""kill x boars"" nonsense you see anywhere else. This game respects your time.

What to say about the combat? Deep and strategic, simply put. Again, if you face your enemies like you would have done in Assassins Creed you're in for a world of pain and frustration. Combat in Elden Ring is all about observing, learning and committing to each and every action you perform. Take for instance Tree Sentinel. Bastard demolished me for at least two hours, but I eventually killed him, though not before I learned his attacks (and took some good rest so my brain could absorb what I learned). And that's how it was meant to be. Tree Sentinel is now a satisfying memory of a challenge I overcame. See you again in NG+ my friend.

Sadly this game is not for everyone, and it's fine. Just know what you are getting in before you buy it.",0,1

It takes the mechanics and gameplay of each from game and puts them all together and it works. Combat feels great especially when you start finding new arts of war, combined that with spells and the new mounted combat and jump attacks. It took me a slight adjustment period but I'm hooked. The world is huge and full of loot. The trademark atmosphere that's from soft games are known for is here which is impressive given the open world format. The only problem that I had was draw distance I find it unpleasure to look far in open areas, anyway I'd highly recommend to anyone especially a fan of dark souls.",0,1

A constantly surprising and compelling world, even at it's most grotesque and disturbing, I have been utterly engrossed in this title since day one. It has restored my faith in, not only RPGs, but video games in general. It treats the player as a grown-up and lets you create your own story, your own myth, in a world that rewards curiosity, bravery and ingenuity.

It's not a game for everyone. At times it's a game that demands a great deal, perhaps more than many players will want to give. But given the time and the dedication you are rewarded with one of the most memorable experiences in video game history.",0,1

The world and story of the game is very interesting and I always keep my ears open for new facts about the Lands Between and the characters.

"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Game is actually a 9/10 at this point from my perspective but since some butt-hurt people drag down the score, complaining about a game made by the Dark Souls creators, inspired by Dark Souls, playing like Dark Souls in open world... I gladly rate 10/10 to even the score :) If this type of game isn't for you and you still play it, just to hate on it...the game is not to blame. I don't like racing games for example, so I don't play them. Duh.

There ARE slight performance issues on PS5 as of yet. Won't deny that. 60 FPS is almost consistent and framerate never drops in combat though.

""The open world feels empty"". No, it certainly doesn't. If the average playtime is 50 hours for ONLY the main story and 115+ hours for completionists...it is NOT empty. Finished my first playthrough in about 120 hours and STILL found new areas, NPC, enemies, quest lines in my next.
Almost everything exists in this game for a lore related reason, thus feeling relevant and worth exploring.
The dungeons definitely repeat from a visual perspective but always have their own theme in terms of mechanics.

Some enemies exist more often than others. Why? For multiple reasons.
The world of Elden Ring is very large, as initially said. Creating a number of unique enemies for every cave is close to impossible. Imagine you go back to one of the most successful open world games ever, Skyrim, and complain about repeating enemies and NPC. Can't recall how many Draugr I have killed in that game or how many times I encountered the same damn child model taunting me.
You also feel a kind of progression as character and player. Better stats and more knowledge about enemy behavior is heavily rewarding, when encountering them more than once.
Areas always have a theme. Some enemies are more likely to appear in area A and others in area B. But that's just damn logical. Never seen a penguin in Egypt but maybe in a zoo. Have you?

Graphics are good, not insane. Visual and level design are great though.
Story is, as always in Souls Games, puzzling but beautiful and very fitting for the open world design. As said before, finding items which hint in their item descriptions to pieces of the lore, doing quest lines or finding new areas feels awesome and engaging for that reason.
The gameplay is very close to a Dark Souls game, difference being you can explore the open world if you don't succeed in one place and come back with better equipment.

This is definitely a contender for game of the year. I would personally already call it out as such but God of War Ragnarok is still to be released.",0,1

"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"250+ Hours. Nearly perfect.

Why the 1 point deduction?
- Graphics are good, but not up to AAA standards for Ps5
- Sadly, no real ps4 to ps5 differences besides performance
- There is no hand-holding. For some players, this may feel cruel.
- At times, solutions to roadblocks are so left-field it's near impossible without community hints.
- Takes a solid 20-30 hours before progress feels fluid.

Why the 9?
- Best open world combat to date. You'll likely replay the entire game to try a different combat style.
- It's huge. 250+ hours and I'm only now getting around to beating it.
- Hard, but not as hard as other Souls games. You can get OP fast if it's your intention.
- Secrets galore. The world is littered with breadcrumbs to sidetrack you in the best way possible.
- Risk/Reward is balanced. When it's ""too much"", you're probably in the right place at the wrong time.
- True gaming glory. No doubt you die a lot, but victories have never felt more fun and meaningful.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Gameplay...Dark Souls at it's best. If you love Dark Souls, then this is hands down a W. Atmosphere and world design is superg, art design is great, horse combat actually kinda fun, combat engaging and challenging. 60 hours and it's like the game that keeps on giving. Cons: lazy cut and paste assets, mechanics such as jumping could be improved with a climbing mechanic, combat is a bit samey from other souls game, albeit more refined. For all it's success, I find it disappointing that From can't improve on their graphics. Clippings, outdated animations and assets, half-ass textures, , AI can be nonexistent at times. All that said, Dark Souls blood runs deep and if you're a fan, then it's easily the masterpiece we've been waiting for. I really hope scores less than a 7 gets removed.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This game is a masterpiece. I picked up the game Friday, started playing about 7pm. It’s now 11.30am on Sunday, and have 22 hours played.The world design is a massive step forward for open world games. You are given no direction, and yet quite quickly, become engrossed in exploration, Elden Ring doesn’t want to let you go. There’re enemies and items in every direction. Caves, camps, villages, ruins, castles and keeps, what they’ve achieved here is something great. The crafting is simple and does not distract you from the core mechanics of the game. The world is huge, In my 22 hours, I’ve only had two boss models be repeated / reused, and even in those cases, the boss had either a different weapon or something added to the fight to mix things up.The combat is fluid and, while it has it’s quirks, it’s essentially what we’ve come to expect in a From game. The bosses are varied in both aesthetic and challenge. While most will not deliver that frustration and block to progression your first stab at Smough and Ornstein did 10 years ago, they test your skill and knowledge of the game non the less.People seem obsessed with the performance and graphics of the game. Well, no From game is known for it’s stellar performance on release . Either they’re not familiar with From games, or they are, and they’re just sensitive to fps dips. The game does drop below 60 dps in performance mode on PS5, but never to an extent that results in the game crashing or becoming unplayable. I’ve had graphical pop ins, bugs where my mount didn’t spawn in and I was left flying in mid air, rendering issues, and fps drops. But none of that has affected my enjoyment of Elden Ring because… this game is everything we could have asked for and From have knocked it out of the park.On the graphical issues and performance, people need some perspective. No PS5 game runs well in any sort of the quality, resolution, cinematic mode, the fps is always unbearable… we’re two years in and this is still the case. Nobody talks about this. All PS5 games are essentially last gen (PS4) ports with checkboarding resolution / upscaling. In general, almost every game released nowadays is unfinished, and the price tag for exclusives and annual releases has gone up to £60 or £70. You can’t have everything I’m afraid, we have backward compatibility, well, we sacrificed a true generational leap in the progress. Elden Ring does what it can with the limitations placed on it for having to be developed for 5 different platforms, I can almost guarantee that the game would be better optimised and look better overall, if it were only developed for PS5, Series X and PC.One last note. Graphically the game is somewhat identical to Dark Souls 3. But to come out with what they’ve produced in the 4 or 5 years since Senior, is nothing short of astounding. Yes, it is disappointing that we’re not looking at Demon’s Souls aesthetics, but please remember that Demon’s Souls was PS5 only, all development time went into optimising the game for that platform. Elden Ring has been developed with last PS4 players in mind.",0,2

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"By far the best out of the series. Never had a game make me drop my jaw as much as elden ring (and trust, I've played ALOT of games). The art and world design is next level, while it may look simple at first, after the castle everything changes. The bosses are next level to, there are multiple that in any other game, you'd expect it to be the final boss. Granted it's not, you are only getting started. Lol, The designs, moves and abilities just leave you there in awe..Would without question recommend this game to anyone! Granted I will say, this game doesnt hold your hand. It doesn't tell you where to go besides a vague yellow light (grace) or if you skipped something. It really makes you feel like you are truly in control of your own story. You get to choose your own path right at the get go. Also combat is MASSIVELY improved from the past games. There are SO many different melee abilities or spells that really change up the game!Personally, I'll never forget my experiences playing this game, it makes me feel like a kid again, actually staying up all night to get past a certain point.Games like these only come once in a generation. If I was you, I wouldn't miss out on this masterpiece! 10/10. Also if you are worried about framerate, dont be. It's very rare and only in certain areas. Even then it's not bad at all and knowing fromsoftware, I'm sure it'll get fixed soon.",0,1

"Mar 18, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Wow, Fromsoft yet again stepping up the game again with this genre defining title. Were initially i was feeling quite skeptical about the open world, however it sold me when I reached the first of many legacy dungeons. the combat shines again, maybe less refined than a title like Sekiro, however still holds its own above most others in the genre. The level design in the legacy dungeons is carefully thought out and expertly organized in a interconnected maze, however the smaller dungeons often leave me wanting a better system.
The Boss fights again are amazing, showing off a wide variety of designs and styles, however the repeated bosses and ""gank"" bosses often are frustrating, to what otherwise is almost a perfect experience.
The visual design is again at times breathtaking, however its not the best looking of the ps5 generation, however more than passable!
This is probably the most accessible of the Fromsoft games, with the most options ever for newcomers (Use magic ;)), and this is probably why it has gained the biggest following yet for a Fromsoft game.

Would definitely recommend for people curious or interested in the series but have always been to nervous to try!",0,1

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This game blew past my every expectation, the enemies and bosses had great movesets that were, of course, punishing but fair. The enemy variety is quite frankly, insane to behold. How they could've put so much variety into that many different creatures is amazing. A few moves here and there were taken from previous FromSoft games, but with the staggering size of everything, it's quite frankly a drop in the bucket. Game devs do this all the time, nothing unusual here.

The scenery was absolutely gorgeous: there were breathtaking vistas full of color; castles, churches, mysterious structures dotted the horizon, dungeons and mines below ground beckoned me to explore their depths. The first zone alone blew my mind, the ones that came after just as great. Want intricately designed buildings to explore, classic Dark Souls style? Morne's Castle and Stormveil Castle got you covered. Want to explore an open world on horseback, running through rivers, forests and fields? You can do that too!

The graphics, while not as great as something like Demon's Souls Remastered, were still quite good. It's at exactly the level you'd expect for a game that released on both next gen and previous gen hardware. Anyone saying differently is insane, check out screenshots or video yourself. Everything ran smoothly for me as well, I didn't notice any horrendous frame drops or stuttering, it ran as a good as any other game I've played. But really, the feeling of clearing a new zone, and then rounding the corner to experience a completely new area left my jaw on the floor every time.

Never did I feel like the game was unfair to me either, and if something seemed too hard, I could easily go level up my stats or weapons elsewhere and come back stronger. Bosses and enemies demand your attention and respect, but failure is solely on the user and not a poorly designed encounter.

Quests, like in other FromSoft games, were very much small options to do on the side and offered to flesh out the world in cool ways. If you're coming in expecting to to be led around with map markers to clear bandit camps, I'd recommend playing something else like a new Assassin's Creed instead. That sounds mean, and it isn't meant to be, it's just a fundamentally different type of RPG, and not everyone is gonna know what to expect. And that's ok! Like previous FromSoft games, the wiki will eventually be updated with all pertinent quest information, so if you can't quite find your way through a quest, you can look on there.

To me, this game is a 10/10. It isn't perfect, but that isn't what a 10 means in reviews. It completely surpassed my expectations, and every day I woke up feeling like it was Christmas morning with how excited I was to play it. With how many disappointing games released in 2021, we needed this win.

I hope whoever reads this doesn't take the 0's as true fact. Most are disingenuous and review bomb worthy, citing issues on the PC port (this isn't even the PC game) or just straight up lying. The mixed reviews are a far better barometer of dislike, and if you're on the fence about buying, try reading those. People giving the game a 0 because of ""PS3 graphics"" aren't going to be giving accurate assessments of the title.

Overall, Elden Ring hits every mark, and it was much better than I could've ever hoped for. It's different than a lot of the more popular RPG's that people are more familiar with. Please don't write it off because it doesn't guide you along as close as other games too. It's an experience that I've not felt before, and it has raised the bar for games in general. I hope you can experience it for yourself.",0,1

Also its a painful experience some of you I know enjoy a game that is difficult but some of us just want to plug in for a couple hours occasionally and enjoy ourselves this game is another one of those were if you want to enjoy the game you better grind things out for a month leveling up your character so that every encounter does not end immediately in your death. I know it sounds like I am bashing the game but I am not I do enjoy it but it just sucks because this could have been no very much better with just a few tweaks.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I'm 35 hours in, and I am completely blown away. The only thing more fun than the time I've put in is knowing just how much more content there is left to explore. I don't often leave reviews for games, but when I saw some of the review-bombing that the PS5 version of Elden Ring is getting on here, I figured I had to say my piece.
First off, there are clearly tons of people who are on the wrong page and don't realize it. The PC port is not very well done and I won't say anything to defend it, but to come to the PS5 listing and complain about PC frame rate issues, lack of ultrawide support and other issues that clearly have nothing to do with PS5 is extremely dishonest. If you removed all of the negative reviews that have been clearly left on the wrong page, the score would be like 10 points higher. It's a shame that people can outright post that they are reviewing the wrong game as part of their review feedback, and that review just stays up and potentially affects other's opinions. I think Metacritic should remove reviews that are posted to the wrong platform.
That aside, the game is astonishing. The folks saying that the open world is flat or empty must be playing a completely different game than I am. You can barely run for 30 seconds before finding something interesting. I am probably not even a third into the game and I have found so many things that have surprised and intrigued me that I have lost count. Some assets (like catacombs) are re-configured and re-used, but when maybe 4 out of the 100+ points of interest I've found are re-configured, that is completely okay with me.
As for the folks who are saying that this game is re-using assets (animations etc.) as a form of criticism, I think they are being completely unrealistic. For a game of this magnitude to exist, that was a tool that FromSoft had which made it possible in the first place. They have a pile of animation rigs, AI and other assets from other games they have published on this engine, and it seems to me that their swan song for that robust engine is to take all of the best from it and use it (plus countless new assets) to build a gargantuan game which would not otherwise be possible, and to give an incredible amount of content to players who enjoy the material FromSoft creates.
I suspect that the hype, mostly by gaming news sites with reviewers that have come to love FromSoft games, has led to many new folks picking up Elden Ring who have not played other FromSoft games and have no idea what they are getting into. That clearly shows in some of the reviews that are listing series staples as design flaws.
In short, the PS5 version of this game is the way to go, and it runs perfectly. The graphics are fantastic considering the unimaginable scope of this game, and the gameplay is perfect. Go explore, get lost, get killed, get lost somewhere else, get stronger and come back to get revenge. This game is truly open-ended, and everything is possible right from the start. It feels like being dropped into a living, breathing world with endless mysteries to unravel. If that sounds cool to you, you will enjoy this game.",0,2

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"Siamo onesti. Se lo confrontiamo con i giochi from, è effettivamente un gioco da 9. Anche confrontandolo con i giochi from non darei 10 perché a mio avviso bloodborn era ancora più ispirato, non che elden ring non lo sia.Detto ciò, essendo che nel mondo video ludico non ci sono solo i giochi From la valutazione deve essere differente. Soprattutto considerando l’enorme mole di giochi open world disponibili.Il mondo è estremamente statico, nemmeno la vegetazione reagisce minimamente al passaggio del PG, cosa non da PlayStation 4 ma da PlayStation 3. Il mondo se non per la presenza di mostri (a volte molto ispirati e comunque presenti in grande varietà) è totalmente morto e vuoto. Tecnicamente parlando siamo di fronte a un gioco a inizio generazione PlayStation 4, non ci passo sopra “perché è From”, sopratutto considerando il frame rate instabile in un gioco di questo tipo.Tralasciando il reparto tecnico insufficiente, ci sono state belle innovazioni nel combattimento come ceneri e il salto. Ma si tira dietro i classici problemi della saga. Hitbox imprecise, animazioni legnose e imprecise. Con animazioni imprecise intendo che per fare un parry l’unica cosa da fare è imparare a memoria il tempismo andando a tentativi. Perché in base al nemico il tempismo cambia ma non segue l’animazione. Quindi abbiamo un sistema di combattimento difficile NON per una AI particolarmente efficace e per un combattimento estremamente tecnico e profondo, ma semplicemente perché non è fatto come si deve. Anche perché è un sistema di combattimento abbastanza basilare.Reparto creativo eccellente, bellissimo a livello artistico. E per chi piace, ottima anche la “narrativa”. In sostanza, come gioco From gioco da 9, come gioco nel mondo reale dove esiste la concorrenza e le altre case di sviluppo, oltre al 7 questo titolo non merita.",0,2

I wouldn’t call myself a particularly good souls gamer but with enough willpower or cheesing if you have to you can make it through. For people saying character design is bad or there’s an empty open world it’s not true, many people couldn’t make it past the first or second boss and it left a bad taste in their mouth seeing other people progress and have fun, these games aren’t for everyone and that’s ok but reviewbombing is just dumb.

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,I have payed many of the soulsbourne games before and I never enjoyed them very much but Elden Ring is one of the greatest games I have ever played in my entire life. With so many video games in recent years being open world's and them all being so similar it is so nice to see a new and fresh take on open world. There is no quest log or objective markers the game is just about exploring all there is in the way of guidance is a beam of light pointing the way you are supposed to go to continue the story at some checkpoints. But all side quests and areas you have to discover on your own and that is so cool because most open world's tell you exactly where to go and so you just head straight for that direction no really exploring alot but this game since you don't know exactly where to go you have to explore to find everything and it tells completely different then most open world's. The world is massive and has so many secrets to find and areas to explore. There are entire massive underground areas that you find just through exploring and can be completely missed. Everywhere you go you never know what you are gonna find even after 60 hours you are still finding completely new and unexpected things. If you for some reason just want a traditional souls game and want to miss out on the amazing world the game has you can do that too because you can just follow the path through the story though I highly recommend not doing that because the world is one of the main things that makes this game so great. The game is hard obviously but the feeling you get after trying a boss for hours and finally beating it in amazing. I still highly recommend this game for people who don't want to spend hours and bosses because if you want to you can summon other players to help you defeat the bosses and it makes the game alot easier (the closest you get to an easy mode). This game it is so unique and special and there is not really any games that it is even comparable to. Whether you like past souls games or not and whether you like open world games or not you should atleast try this game because it is nothing like past souls games or open world games or really any games for that matter.,0,1

And either peoples consoles are just made bad and outta luck or they just hating and trying to give more hate I get almost no frame rate issues other than teleporting to a place then it’s drops for a second or 2 then that’s it back to 60",0,1

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Most of the negative reviews have nothing to do with the actual gameplay or story. I understand frustration with frame drops and technical issues, but I've seen plenty of people giving the game a 10 even with experiencing the same issues. This game is absolutely phenomenal. As someone who has played and beaten most of the souls games multiple times, this is a dream come true. An open world dark souls just makes so much sense. Every game rewarded exploring, and this does that times a million. A vast and punishing world, where if you're getting stomped by a boss for a few hours, you can leave and explore a new area to gain more runes and level your character/weapons. And on the way you might find a new weapon, or armor set. Maybe a golden seed or sacred tear to upgrade your flasks. Then you can go back and beat the boss. In all the other souls games, you'd have to farm souls for hours, but this makes it possible to not do that, while it is still available if you want too. People are frustrated with boss mechanics and timing, but I've actually enjoyed overcoming some of this. They definitely changed some of the timing in comparison to ds1 through 3. I've noticed some of the bosses have crazy long swings that are at first hard to navigate around when used to the quick movements of most of the previous game bosses. I like that they made it more accessible in some ways for new players, but made it even harder in other ways for souls veterans. At about half way through the game, I can easily say this is up there for the best from software game, and one of the best open world games of all time. Oh and there's a mount, enough said 10/10",0,1
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Definitely lived up to the hype! The world is so easy to get addicted to. The game lets go explore and find more about the lore itself. Of course with this being a fromsoftware game, it is very very challenging. I find there to be a beauty to that. Use your eyes and learn how to defeat each boss or enemy you come across. Also, being a massive Berserk fan, there are tons of little Easter eggs, weapons and gear that pay homage to the great manga. Becoming one of my favourite games ever.",0,1
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is quite Literally the best game I have ever played. The open world is sprawling with life, every book and cranny is filled with something cool to Find. The mini-dungeons are a little same-y But not to an extent i found detrimental to the games overall enjoyment. The minibosses, although sometimes recycled added a lot of enjoyment, and sometimes Even more challenge than major bosses. You can Tell every area apart just from looking at a screenshot, the color schemes are different and varied to separate them. The orange/yellow altus to the blue liurnia, the reds of caelid.The performance was mostly 55+ fps, worst drops happening in altus to maybe 45. A few small fps drops here and There Dont deter from my enjoyment either. Frames never dropped during bosses either.The enemy variety is frankly impressive, say compared to breath of the wild(Another great Open world game).The jump button allows for a verticality in fromsofts world design and torrent helps with traversing huge swathes of land while taking in the scenery. This game is truly the first time Ive experienced ”If You can see it You can go There”.The bosses are all a treat. Margit is a great first boss, teaching players that This game Isnt going to go easy on you. I can genuinely say that there isn’t a single bad boss, compare it to say, Dark souls 2 where basically every boss except maybe knight alonne is pretty bad and not memorable at all.The ashes of war is one of the best new additions to elden ring. The freedom it gives is a great addition to increase build variety. Mash all of This together and You get one of the best games of all time. I genuinely cant Think of any issues other than performance at some points.",0,1
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"A very big adventure to become the Elden Lord. I came into this game very new to FromSoftware games and at first, It was very hard and I almost quit. After playing for about ten more hours I got used to it and now it is addicted. This game is very challenging and might take gamers that are not used to these types of games much longer to become the Elden Lord. I find myself dying and recollecting my ruins so much doing each playthrough. I think even if you're not great at these games that you might find something to enjoy about it. For me, collecting ruins and leveling up until I am strong enough to beat a boss is pretty fun. The graphics for this game is very beautiful. The framerate is very good in performance mode with some dips. It really feels like I am in a dark and twisted world. Overall, I think that this is the most fun I've had with a game in forever. I highly recommend it.",0,1
"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Ignore all of these terribly made negative reviews youre seeing. This game is a masterpiece and I highly suspect the majority of them are from people who have struggled to get past the first boss alone and have been stuck wandering the beginning areas of the game. The world of Elden Ring is expansive and lively, from countless enemies around almost every corner to 83 bosses in total, 77 of which are completely unique from one another, to the huge amount of NPC’s both hidden and in plain view for you to interact with. Elden Ring is the totality of everything From Soft has learned over the decades of making the Soulsborne games and put them all together for both veterans of the series and newcomers to enjoy. This game however is not for the faint of heart, you will grow frustrated with bosses or enemies at points, that’s a staple of any Soulsborne game and that’s what brings so much enjoyment out of it when you finally overcome that boss you spent an extended amount of time on, just to turn around and get knocked back down by the next area of enemies or bosses. It’s a rollercoaster ride of pain and excitement all at once. That’s not even going into depth on the sheer amount of lore and Easter eggs that are hidden in the game. My only knock is that sure there are some technical issues here and there  and the graphics aren’t the best we’ve ever seen but the issues are nothing patches to the game can’t fix, many of these issues are already being looked into by From Software as well. Moral of the review is that this game is worth every single penny spent on it and will bring you hours, days and possibly even weeks of enjoyment, pain, excitement and frustration in all of the right ways on just your first play through alone.",0,1

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"VERDICT:

As someone who's beaten every FromSoftware Soulsborne game enough times for it to seem like it's my full time job, I can say with certainty that Elden Ring is the best game they've made in the genre and arguably the best game ever made. I'm currently 50 hours in with an incredible amount of content cleared and tons more yet to be explored. It's genuinely mind blowing how a game of this magnitude, polish, and replay-ability was released only 3 years after FromSoftware's last game (Sekiro) which was also incredible.

In an age of talentless TripleA developers pumping out unfinished and uninspired garbage year after year for upwards of $70 USD just for the standard copy, Elden Ring takes me back to the good ole days of paying $60 for a complete experience that does not need updates and will satisfy me for years to come. Granted every FromSoftware game since Demons Souls has been more than worth the price of admission, but this one is on a whole other level. This game has an enormous world that's never boring to explore, a staggering 80+ bosses, limitless build options, and near infinite replay value. Not to mention it has some of the coolest weapons, bosses, and most beautiful locations I've ever seen in a game. Elden Ring easily deserves the highest praise it can get with a 10/10 score from me and it sets a new bar for this genre and gaming in general that at this point only FromSoftware can top. The rest of the industry needs to take notice. This is how you make a game for the fans and not for the money.

WHAT IS ELDEN RING?

Elden Ring is a new game and new universe created by FromSoftware in association with George R.R Martin. It is the next evolution in FromSoftware's ""souls"" genre that they started way back with Demons Souls in 2009 on the PS3. It takes that classic souls formula of deep RPG elements, punishing stamina based combat that requires timing and patience to master, losing your level up currency upon death (in this case runes) and needing to retrieve them before dying again and losing them forever, difficult boss battles, bonfire checkpoints (they're called sites of grace in Elden Ring) that allow you to fill up on your healing and mana while simultaneously respawning the enemies, and it puts all these mechanics on an open world scale that is absolutely enormous. In order to explore the world at a decent pace you're given a horse soon after completing the tutorial area. This changes the way you play the game in many ways since fighting while on the horse is a more than viable option in a lot of scenarios even in it does take some getting used to. Do keep in mind though that there are some areas in which you can't use the horse, but that's ok because it's typically in areas that you wouldn't want to use it anyways.

Elden Ring also has countless builds, weapons, armor, and abilities that allow you to play the game in so many ways that you probably won't get to use everything for a very long time which makes it great for replay value.

One final thing to note about this game as well as the other games in the souls genre is that they are not easy in the beginning. These games are notorious for their difficulty which is true to an extent. If you are unwilling to learn from your mistakes and adapt then this game will probably be too much for you to handle. It will test your patience and awareness early on and if you are willing to get better, it will only be a matter of time before you're taking down the baddest of bosses and wondering why you ever thought things were difficult in the first place. I will have a section at the bottom that will include ways to get better if you're struggling so be sure to read that.

IN RESPONSE TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND FRUSTRATED PLAYERS:

I felt like making this section in hopes that new players and people who are giving up on the game early can read this. Elden Ring as well as the other games in the souls genre are not unfair, they are not impossible, and they can absolutely be mastered to a point where it's not even a challenge anymore. I see a lot of people just get mad, quit, and either stop playing entirely or write a negative review saying the game is bad when in reality it was their own fault. They were either unwilling to learn from their mistakes or the game is just not for them. Neither of which make the game bad. Here is some general advice for those of you are struggling and find the game to be too difficult:

1. Learn an enemies moveset before going all out on attacks. If you know when an enemy's attacks/combo ends, you know when to get a free hit.

2. Don't be greedy. Always try to get at least one-two hits in and then wait for the enemies attacks to finish.

3. Summon help if you need it. You can either summon NPCs for certain fights, spirit ashes which let you fight with NPC mobs of your choosing, or real players.

4. Farm runes for levels. This isn't the fun way, but every bit of extra damage helps.",0,1

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,1,"I liked Demon’s Souls back in the day and played Bloodborne, so I had an idea of what to expect from a soulslike game.  However this game has been hyped all over the internet as more approachable than a typical From game, and has the added draw of having a “story” “written” by GRRM.  There is nothing accessible or intriguing about this game.  Having played other soulslike games only makes the predictable opening and tedious slog of looping through areas again and again feel tired and stale . The combat is much worse and less responsive than in other From games I played. And I felt no sense of wonder or excitement from exploration.  As for the story, after a few hours in, I really was unable to discern what GRRM had brought the table.  There was nothing worth staying in this world for.  I just deleted the game.  Total waste of money.  Can’t even get a refund because I was dumb enough to buy it from the PSN store.",0,2
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Is Elden Ring ""just"" an open world Dark Souls? Yes.

First lets talk about the dungeons and castles, generally speaking the close quarter areas.

They are what you would expect from a like, many different paths to choose with many different and difficult enemies inside. Just perfection.

Then we have the open world.

The open world is OK. It is not bad but also not great either.

You have some roaming enemies, some bigger and badder than others.

The open world might throw some souls players off because they are not used to so much freedom.

But this is the point that makes Elden Ring good.

You WANT to see what is behind that corner, what is inside that cave, what is over there, the freedom

From Software has given is amazing.

Concluding:

Elden Ring is a good game. In some areas, just what you expect from a Souls game, the open world might throw you a bit off, but the same open world can suck you in into the world of Elden Ring",0,1

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This game exceeded my expectations. The open world is much bigger and richer than I could have expected. Exploring is as satisfying as the combat is challenging.

This game keeps the challenge of Dark Souls that I became to love while providing a really vast and interesting world to explore. The already well tuned combat system got even richer with this installment. I have to add that the difficulty is higher than I expected as well. I feared it would become an easy cakewalk, but was happily surprised that the iconic challenge of Dark Souls games remained for this installment as well.

The only downside I see is that solo hosts have to opt-into PvP which gives you a very hard time as a new invader.

It should not come as a surprise that the graphics are good, but the focus lies on the game play. I personally really like the environments and stood in awe more than once, but the visuals are obviously not as good as Demon's Souls or other graphic focused current gen games.

"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,2,"Some truth needs to be told here... I literally just created an account to leave this review. I don't even leave reviews for any games or products, but this game deserves one. See below:

Those reviews seems to be financed by marketing. The game is fantastic don't get me wrong. It doesn't have a proper story, but who expects a story from these kind of games. It's more about the exploration/fighting. I love it, and it's basically DS4 in an open world filled with interesting things.

Now that I mentioned the best part about it, here is what's wrong with this game. The game has TECHNICAL ISSUES that no one is talking about. I lost 6 hours (10 level worth) on my PS5 yesterday because it's saving system is broken. It literally DOES NOT SAVE, it does not even give you a warning, nothing. You just don't know it. When you try to quit the game, then close it (like developers recommended), and then suddenly it crashes your ps5 and turns it off, just be sure that how many hours you have put in it that specific walk through, did not count one bit.

However, it's not game breaking like Demon Souls, and that's fine, fans of the souls series never came for the graphics, but they were always appreciated. The graphics have their good moments, and their bad ones. For example, the door to the walking mausoleum is extremely low quality, it's unsettling, but not enough to remove a point from the score. The fight against Rennala Queen of The Full Moon was gorgeous, the look of the spells is better than they've ever been.

GAMEPLAY:
Elden Ring rewards players for exploration, whether the reward is smithing stones for upgrades, or one of 83 bosses in the game, no matter which one however, the player is guaranteed to get an item that might be of use to them. Unlike past games, Elden Ring allows you to prepare for bosses, to come back whenever you're stronger after being defeated by a boss you weren't able to defeat, this allows the game to be either the hardest of all Fromsoftware games, or the easiest, depending on how you play.

COMBAT:
This will be short. The combat in Elden Ring is the basic combat we're used to in every other souls game, but better. In Dark Souls you'd typically dodge the boss waiting for an opening, then use your regular attack. However, Elden Ring has adopted the posture system from Sekiro, making heavy attacks and jumping heavy attacks used more. The bosses as I've seen are also more aggressive than previous games. You can't just go in with heavy armor and a big weapon expecting to defeat the boss easily, you have to find out their moves, see which ones give the biggest openings for attacks, and hopefully get a hit in. Torrent, the spectral steed that you get early on, also contributes much to fights. Often times you'll find yourself relying on Torrent to have an easier time with some bosses.

PERFORMANCE:
At launch the performance on PC was poor to say the least, which is understandable seeing as this is the first time Fromsoftware has done an open world game like Elden Ring. However, patches are being released in order to fix optimization issues. A patch was released recently which seemed to fix the issue, if not at least a little bit.

If you're a person who's always wanted to play a game like Dark Souls but is afraid of the difficulty, now is the time to purchase Elden Ring. If you don't like it, you can always refund it on Steam.",0,1
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,I think this game is at least top 5 games of all time played through it fully and had no performance errors and I would recommend this to anyone,0,1
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Elden Ring is by far the greatest video game to come out since Fallout 3 and Bloodborne. It will most likely go down as the best video game ever made. It’s basically perfect.,0,1
"Mar  2, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Absolutely amazing game I've always loved dark souls games but could never finish them this is the first I've been able to get past the 3 hour mark tho it's still crazy difficult the world is massive and beautiful bosses are challenging and fun the only flaw I see is the locked frame rate as I have a hi end PC that could most definitely be capable of pushing out more then 60 fps,0,1

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"No he sido nunca muy matado de los Souls, nunca he podido jugar más de 2 o 3 horas seguidas por la tensión y por la frustración de determinados momentos. Elden Ring elimina los momentos más frustrantes (como patearte un cuarto de nivel cada vez que te mata el boss) y te da libertad de jugar a tu ritmo ¿El resultado? Una droga de juego del que solo quieres más y más y él te lo da.Es cierto que hay algún que otro problema gráfico y de rendimiento en PS5 pero me ha dado exactamente igual, además espero que se solucionen con los parches.Creo que la gente que lo puntúa a la baja por lo técnico es porque tienen vidas bastante pobres. OJO, hablo de la versión de PS5 que es la que he jugado, tengo entendido que la de PC va bastante peor si no tienes un PC de muy alta gama. No obstante, por eso valoro la versión de PS5.",0,1

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Habitually, I'm not a fan of open world games, but this game is perfect. You don't feel like your an errand boy, you can really take the time to admire the details of this world.  Boss fights are brutal you have think and not stupidly run into the fights. Of course if you like to be taken by the hand this might not be a game for you.",0,2
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This is the most fun I've had with a game in ages.If you enjoy Souls games, you'll enjoy Elden Ring. If this is your first time, it's the best time to jump in, as the open world allows you to come back to an area later if you're struggling with it.What I love about these games, is that it lets you explore the world without necessarily throwing everything in your face. It leaves a lot open for you to interpret, in the best way.I also love the feeling of struggling with a boss, but figuring out his pattern and moves step by step, until finally you beat him after you just feel so accomplished. Not to mention the different playstyles you can go for, the different weapons you can use and on top of that the improved magic system.Elden Ring definitely gets close to a 10 for me, personally, and with the fake reviews, and the pretentious people seeking attention by giving it a 0 because ""it's DS3"", I definitely think it deserves it.",0,2
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This game is a MASTERPIECE!! Everything you can find is exciting, every corner has something.

Praise the Elden Ring!.,0,1
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This game is absolutely insane. It does a fantastic job of being challenging and hard without being frustrating and anger-inducing. Every time you think you’ve discovered all of the map, or searched a dungeon, there’s always one more thing to keep you immersed into the beautifully intricate world. The soundtrack is one of the only in games i’ve played that’s made me feel a chill down my spine, and the boss themes enhance the feeling of grandness as you fight monstrosity after monstrosity. Despite its stat and inventory limitations (which isn’t a bad thing, it’s even more of an incentive to find treasure), you’re given complete freedom from the moment you step past the tutorial. There’s a main story that can be picked up and dropped at any point in the game, allowing for getting better gear or weapon upgrades, general exploration, or just taking a break to buy more supplies. Almost every aspect of this game blows me away, and i think it’s an absolute must play.",0,1
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,A lot of crying going on here...  GET GOOD. The game is great and people who complain about it being to hard should go back to playing animal crossing.

I will definitely be playing this game for years to come.",0,1
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Review bombers won’t be able to keep this from being remembered as a masterpiece. I gotta jump on here to defend it against the review bombers. This is my first Soulsborne game ever. I’m roughly 40 hours into the game right now. This is not for the casual gamer at all. If you like a challenge and you like puzzle solving and don’t get frustrated easily then you will enjoy it. It honestly is the best game I’ve played in the last few years. It’s not perfect and has plenty of bugs and performance issues but the quality of gameplay and world design absolutely outshines all the bad. People can cry on here all they want but this game will go down as a masterpiece.,0,2

The fact that your map isnt full of markers is a great change from other open world games. The lack of quest log is also refreshing. It's nice that you have to learn to play and learn how to navigate around. I've only finished bloodborne before so not really a fan of souls games but this game will propably be my favourite all time game. World is really beautiful, controls feels smooth, lore feels interesting, boss fights are fun and different. There is so much great things in this game and I hate these trolls giving 0s and 1s because they propably didn't even try the game and watched some stream or the didnt have patience to learn after tutorial area.",0,1

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,3,"Graphics are amazing and I really wish that I could explore the world more thoroughly… but… the problem is that every corner you turn, every bend you go around, every path you travel is absolutely packed full of danger with monsters that kill you in 2 hits… everywhere! Also, when you die, the monsters that you have just slogged for ages to slowly chip away at return. If you get stuck somewhere… you’re stuck for good! It is just too hard… no difficulty settings, no save games, just essentially “checkpoints”. Booby trapped chests that transport you to death traps… I’ve been playing for two hours now and I’m literally over it. I’ve been slaughtered at least 30 times. This is not like Skyrim, Elder Scrolls, Fallout or any other MMORPG, so don’t expect to ease in. You’re literally dropped in with a crap sword and shield that do stuff all damage. Don’t think you’re just gonna waltz around picking up weapons or armour off slain monsters or defeated enemies… oh no… won’t be doing that. I was excited about this game, but no I literally hate it… I want to love it, but it is a complete downer with little fun to be had.",0,1
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,2,"This game is a heuristic nightmare for beginners and was misleading in how it's marketed.  It does not feel like an open world when everything resets each time you die or use fast travel.  The developer has admitted that George RR Martin didn't write the story, only the mythos.  The story is poorly written, some things got lost in translation perhaps.  There is an illusion of choice, but there's really only one choice that helps, you will be limited in what you can do in game if you make the wrong choice or until you go back and make the right choice.  Your best weapon is Google and others have said, you will die constantly and stare at the loading screen.  Defeating a boss feels more like a relief than a sense of accomplishment.  I wish there had been a trial period because I never would have spent the time and money on this title.  Skill is not as important as level and gear when it comes to defeating bosses, which encourages one to kill the same bosses over and over to level up, then take on the boss with higher gear.  The graphics are pretty and that's worth two stars, watch this on Twitch for the best experience.",0,1

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,4,"If your planning on buying elden ring and playing in between working, family, and having a social life, this is not the game for you. Unless you have endless amount of time to roam around the game and slowly but surely level your character up then this game is certainly for you! As a person who can’t and won’t spend countless hours on a video game, I find this game specifically to be increasingly harder then any of the other dark souls or any other games related to dark souls. I enjoy the mantra of feeling extremely accomplished once you defeat a hard Enemy, but this game takes it to a new level. For anyone who has not played or completed any of the dark souls games, this game will basically be unbeatable. Honestly I cant seem to understand where the 10/10 ratings came from, the graphics are sub-par and the character ability vs enemy ability is just so out of proportion. For a game that i was so unbelievably excited for, this game has ultimately let me down. I expected a sever challenge and was ready for anything this game had to offer, but after a week of being stuck in the same spot with no way to effectively progress through this spot has ultimately turned me away from this game. I congratulate and praise anyone who is skilled enough to be able to surge through the game with minimal pushback from enemies, but it seems me and MANY others do possess the skill or time needed to trek through this game effectively. In no way shape or form do I want the game to change, or have an easy mode or anything like that, i just wish there were ways to use all weapons given to you regardless of arcane level and such. The game needs to be more diversified and give you a fighting chance to be diverse in your attacks towards different enemies. A slow heavy fighter can do a lot of damage, and vise versa,  but versus someone who is extremely fast with more health and more damage that you, it’s basically the same result every time. “You Died” over and over again.",0,1

"Mar 12, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Awesome Game. 179.5 hours invested. intense cutscenes and story lines if you will to put in time.

This game isnt fully optimized, but also most of peoples pc's are **** doodling around with an old ryzen 5 or intel are wondering why a CPU heavy game isnt running well, while their cpu is at 85-90°C.
I had small frame drops in certain areas which are re-createable, cause it was bound to loading of the next big patch of an area. but that was minimized in a patch a few patches later.
I never lagged in an Bossfight.

My only complain is, the reuse of some Dungeon Bosses, just giving them more HP and more Damage, which is simply just boring when you learned the boss already.

Haters gonna hate and vote it down cause people love the game and the genre. Its a Fromsoft game with 5X the current playerbase than dark souls3. from 214k(ds3) or some to a million(ER).
And with hype the casuals and hater come in and talk it bad. while millions of people enjoy the game, they come here to hate and feel better with their problems aka getting **** by the game. laughable",0,2

I've sanked over 100+ hours now, and just beat the game at my own leisure enjoying every nook and cranny the game had to offer for me.. The sceneries of splendors i've walked and rode with (Torrent homeboy4life) Just the sheer brilliance of fantasy and artistry is just.. NEXT LEVEL... some thig insane boss designs i've ever had the pleasure to deal with like Rykard and the Void alien chutulu being from the cosmos/stars!? So many layers.. so many satisfying dungeons and caves to explore, so many amazing weapons with gameplay style changing powers that come along with em.

For all the haters out there.

GIT GUD. You don't have the right! O You don't have right! O praise the Elden Ring and its Elden Lord!

Thank you so much Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin, from the bottom of my heart and all the grandeur developers from Fromsoftware, i bow to you all. And thank you from the bottom of my golden filled with Grace heart! For delivering sucha master piece, its idd One Of The Greats! One Of The Best Games, that's ever been made! No garbage Live service crap or filled with Microtransactions no **** paywalls none of the modern garbage Triple A gaming **** bravado going on here, just a full game from beginning to end with no strings attached, just a epic mind blowing journey of a adventure to behold. Sucha marvelous piece of work this game is, what a breathe of fresh air with all the Fremium/Live Service infested poorly designed games.

I bow to yee all, hats off FromSoftware~

Hope you all enjoyed my love letter to FromSoft~",0,1

"Mar 17, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Well, after 88 ingame hours and finishing the game yesterday, I think I have fair grounds to review this game.Firstly, my only 'soulsborne' games I played before Elden Ring are Dark Souls 3 and Demon's Souls remake. What I liked about those two was that it felt really refreshing and just something new/different from the usual AAA games. The open world RPG genre came to a point where every game felt the same.'?' markers on the map to tell you where to go, being spoon fed the lore with 30-40% of your playtime being dialogue. Quest logs that felt like you were ticking off your laundry list. Generally, being held by your hands the entire time.Soulsborn games just throw you into a world and let the world do the talking. You discover the story all by yourself by pieceing together the things you see and find. Whenever you find a NPC that talks to you it's something special and you cling to their mouths.Elden Ring takes this formula and improved it even more by letting you decide where to go. Every area is filled with dungeons, caves, ruins that tell from a time past. When you encounter an enemy you can't defeat you can always come back later and not be stuck there like in prior Soulsborn games. The combat style is very unique and challenging. You decide if you want to be the big tanky guy with a big hammer that can take some hits or be the agile dual-wielding katana guy that slashes through enemies. Or a Sorcerer that wields powerful spells and attacks from a distance. So many possibilities to choose from.I've seen a lot of reviews saying there is no story and the world is empty. These people are used to being spoon fed the story and being guided by markers on the map. You have to actually play the game to discover something . Crazy right? The more you play, the more you understand the story because you progress through it. In other games the 6 Minute intro tells you everything you need to know about the story and the rest is just bonus dialogue.There are several endings in this game, giving players even more control over how the story turns out and who you want to be in this shattered world.On PS5 I've had no technical issues whatsoever. Not a single crash. The only bug that I discovered was a clipping error which let you see through a wall in Raya Lucaria Academy.I didn't play online or coop that much but I can say that it feels really nice being able to summon other players if you need help. What feels even better is helping other people out when they need help. Multiplayer works great, summoning takes just a few seconds and I never had any connectivity problems.The only thing why I can't give it a 10 is because From Software enabled trolling a little bit too hard. With messages being able to be placed right in front of ladders for example. That way you always accidentally open the message instead of climbing the ladder. If you're in a hurry and want to escape an enemy stuff like that can get you killed. You can however just play offline and none of that will bother you. Also death blight trolls who can team kill you.All-in-all, super polished game with potentially 80-120h of fun. This might not be a game for everyone, yes. But in my opinion the best game to get into the Soulsborn genre. I would recommend it to everyone who wants to have a fresh breeze, a game that truly feels different from all the other triple A games.",0,1

Not a single second I am feeiing this is a fromsoftware game, they never design such one-shot kill system in the past but in this game its everywhere, fully reflecting they just didn't spend much time to balance the difficulty settings, which considered they already had so many boss almost direct copy and paste from previous dark souls game, is beyond acceptable. The combat mechanics is also bad that its simply not fun and not challenging but totally unfair, not withstanding the fact that lagging and unresponsive input that is hardly accpetable as a ps5 game (I finished nioh2 with platinum so dun argue with me I am not good enough, this is simply not a well designed and configured game). I dun know how anyone could put higher than 6 in this game. The only thing perhaps make ppl think this is good game is probably we haven't had a fully open world ARPG game like skyrim for too long.

The game endings are ridiculously bad and you won't understand them anyway.

+ some genius enemy designs
+ some of the hardest and best bosses fromsoft ever made
+ combat is now way more in depth , r1 spamming is still possible but against tougher bosses you will need more tricks up your sleeve.
+ Dozens of weapons , some are absolutely incredible.
+ great music again
+ the legacy dungeons are mostly fantastic
negative
- i consider this as my biggest complaint: pls fromsoft if you can't come up with a new boss, DON'T re-use them or put 2 re-used bosses in 1 room. Just come up with something new or don't make them at all.
-  i said most legacy dungeons are good because i found raya lucaria to be disapointing, it looked awesome in the trailers but it was pretty small and did not come up with anything new.
- perfomance issues
I see a lot of unknowing people in the user reviews that give the game below a 7 , they clearly did not do any effort in looking features up, which is not even necessary because this game guides you enough if you read everything . But people are to lazy to read anyway . If you are reading this then bravo atleast you put some effort in reading this review :) .

"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,7,"This game ranks amongst one of the best games in the Soulsborne genre, but it still lacks what is takes to be a truly great game.

The graphics are excellent, and the combat controls are very responsive, as they need to be in this genre of game. However, that being said, the game falls short on several fronts and demonstrates a lack of developer insight into what makes an exceptional game.

While the combat controls are very responsive, the combat in the game often devolves into enemies crowding the player, with the player fighting the in-game camera as much as they are fighting the enemies. This lack of insight, amongst other things, detracts from what could otherwise be a great game.

Competitor 'souls-like' games (e.g. Nioh) so a better job of pacing the combat properly, and offering players some room to actually see what is going on.

Undoubtedly the weebs will shout their lack-of-brain-cells, lemming-like, mantra of 'git gud', but those shouts of mindless of brainless drivel should be directed at the developers, not the players in an effort to get the devs to put forth that 'git gud' effort into overcoming their own barriers, get rid of some of these mindless, idiotic, pacing and crowding issues that mar what could otherwise be a 10/10 game.

Still, all that said, it is still a very 'good' game...and would still a solid 7/10. It really is a 'good' game; but that's just it...it's good, not 'excellent' or 'exceptional'; it still finds itself leaning on the same tired old soulsborne tropes and cliches. The sole exception to this is that it finally brings magic back into being a viable build.

7/10 was as high as it could possibly go with the problems that still exist; and that have existed since the days of the soulsborne infancy.

Unfortunately the Radahn fight docked that another 2 points because it stands in the way of the player as a 'mandatory' event; and that fight is quite possibly the most terrible fight design I have seen in any modern game. Many other boss fights are likewise a gimmick-driven mess, and not remotely 'fun'. That's not to say that ALL of the boss fights are bad; I would say a solid 30-40% of them are well-designed and good; however unfortunately for only 30-40% of 'good' content, the customer should only be charged about 30-40% of the MSRP cost of the game.

There's also some Game Design 101 flaws, for example many times you have to ""reload the game world"" in order for changes to take effect (e.g. you turn in a quest, and a new pathway is intended to open up; however nothing will happen until you Fast Travel somewhere, forcing the game world to reload)....I mean, seriously, c'mon From Software, that is like High School level basic game design, you guys are supposed to be pros!

All in all, it's decent, and you definitely get your money's worth from a ""time-spent"" perspective, the game is MASSIVE. So that's a positive. The problem is that From Software still fails to deliver a game that is 100% fun to play. It's about 40% fun, and 60% eye-rolling bad design and annoying. Definitely see some substantial improvements for player experience, but they still have a long way to go.

Definitely not the 10/10 experience that the weebs and fangirls are crying out.

I would have to say the biggest downfall is the continued ""lack of respect"" towards a player's playtime. My time is far too valuable to waste it doing the same things over and over again. If the dev's target audience is grade schoolers or people drawing welfare stipends, okay sure; but for honest working folk, we don't have time for repetitive garbage.

Another issue is EXCEPTIONALLY POOR quest design &amp; quality-assurance testing. There is no 'Quest Log' to track your objectives; and if that isn't cumbersome enough, most of the quests are flat-out broken, with 'triggers' not happening reliably, NPCs not appearing where they are supposed to be, etc.  Honestly, I have seen better 'Quest Design' coming out of High School computer classes; are the folks from the Quest team at From Software actually professionals; or are they just like some elementary school students that they allowed to code for some extra credit for a week?

UPDATE: Heard From Software updated the Radahn fight to better balance it. Can't confirm as I'd already beaten him; however I will remove my -2 pt score deduction for that poorly balanced mandatory fight, and update my score to 7/10.

Final Elden Ring verdict, 7/10.",0,0

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Im going to be honest, I was skeptic at first after I heard Elden Ring was going open world. The magic in soulsborne games to me is how FROM guides the players without holding their hands with their linearity. I was worried they’d take a step back from the level design and world building approach we all have been so accustom to. I’m pleased to say I was wrong. The open world is a breath of fresh air and beast of its own. Over the 60+ hours I’ve put into the game so far I’ve had nothing but good times and whenever I put down my controller I immediately want to pick it back up again. It’s intoxicating and anxiety inducing all at once. The vistas, the swamps, the crumbled castles, the dungeons, the lighting and the atmosphere and more is jaw dropping. The world feels alive. The open world fatigue has been a problem for many years now but FROM has managed to take something familiar and make it unfamiliar. They have superseded my expectations in every way possible. Is Elden Ring a perfect game, no. But it’s one of the best open world games ever made if not the best",0,0

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Elden Ring is fascinating!
After getting my platinum for 70 hours, I can clearly say that this game is one of my favorite fromsoft games alongside with Bloodborne and Sekiro.
-Gameplay, is similar to Dark Souls 3, and have some ""must-have"" parts like jumping using only ONE button, and of course the Horse Torrent because of how big the world of the game is.Also kinda new thing is Ashes of War, but they just replace grindstones and gems from Dark Souls 3.
The world of this game is unusual to an open world standard, there 4 types of dungeons in this game:caves,catacombs,hero graves and tunnel and they are all interesting to investigate, and rewards with valuable resources.But for me open world in this game is the worst part of the game,but that doesn’t mean that it is bad, just mediocre, because of the confusion at the start of the game, when u can’t figure out where to go.Sometimes u can go to the high-level locations, and sometimes u can even get to the low-level location already being a high-level player.In my opinion they should’ve done a map layout by progression levels, for example like in Witcher 3.Beside this minus, the world of the game is really good and has an unique atmosphere.
-The main story of this game is one of the best stories from all games from this developer.Only bloodborne , in my opinion is better.Overall the whole conflict in the lands between is the best part of the games lore, all this castle with their opinion about the fracture of the Elden Ring, most of them where trying to take the whole power of the Elden Ring, and for example some folks like Rykard where interested in consuming all of the gods.But if think everyone must experience it, someone may like the lore and story of the game (like me), and some may don’t like.
-Main Bosses the game ( those who carry the shards of the Elden Ring ) are fascinating and unique to the whole Souls-like games.For example General Radahn, I’ve never experienced such an epic fight.All the friends you have met where helping you to fight Radahn, even Blaid with Alexander.Rykard is similar to Giant Yorm ( from DS3 ) and Storm Kings ( DeS ) but way harder than them , also fight is very good and fair.Morgott and Goodrick,Mohg are good but usual to the whole series, but also very ingesting.And the hardest one is Malenia, and god she’s though, the boss the heals himself and has 3 one-shot attacks in first phase, and 3 one-shot attacks in second, also she has 2 health bars.Yeah…that boss is really hard, and clearly the hardest boss in the game and of the hardest bosses from whole fromsoft games.Also the game has a lot of optional bosses : Dragonlord Placidusax (Two-headed Darkeater Midir :3 ), Hoarah Loux the Warrior ( the best boss music in the game ), Rennala Queen of the full moon ( second phase - huge flashback to Rom, the vacuous spider from Bloodborne ), Mimic Tear ( Basically You ), Maliketh ( he’s one not optional, but he look astonishingly beautiful), Regal &amp; Basic Ancestor Spirit ( very relaxing ost , and very good fight ), and so on… This game have a lot of bosses.
-The last thing I want to talk is graphics, and they are decent, not next-gen like in Demon Souls Remake, but not bad at all.
For me Elden Ring became a very interesting journey, with memorable bosses, deep lore, and beautiful locations.And after getting a platinum in this game I already miss it…

I've never noticed how open worlds can just be full of fetch quests and marker to marker traversal until this actually made me take in the surroundings and interact with the world by remembering the locations I'm too underpowered for.

Not a single second I am feeiing this is a fromsoftware game, they never design such one-shot kill system in the past but in this game its everywhere, fully reflecting they just didn't spend much time to balance the difficulty settings, which considered they already had so many boss almost direct copy and paste from previous dark souls game, is beyond acceptable. The combat mechanics is also bad that its simply not fun and not challenging but totally unfair, not withstanding the fact that lagging and unresponsive input that is hardly accpetable as a ps5 game (I finished nioh2 with platinum so dun argue with me I am not good enough, this is simply not a well designed and configured game). I dun know how anyone could put higher than 6 in this game. The only thing perhaps make ppl think this is good game is probably we haven't had a fully open world ARPG game like skyrim for too long.

"Mar 20, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This might be my favorite game of all time,I am a big fan of From Software games and this is the next evolution of the dark souls formula. This is not a game for everyone, if you dont like the soulsbourne series this game might not be for you, these games are obscure by design but if you find that difficult and irritating I would recommend you to look up a beginners guide on youtube and you might just start to enjoy these games.This is not a game where you follow mindlessly a waypoint and get everything spoonfed to you, the game goes out of its way to hide its content. You are activly exploring and looking for clues and the game does an excelent job leaving breadcrumbs for the player to follow and this makes uncovering said content very rewarding. Here is one of many examples:At the time of writing I uncoverd a huge underground dungeon in an area I had already been through, I just went back to kill an optional boss, looked around for a bit, saw an item i could not reach, went looking for the way to said item and ended up finding a huge area hidden away.You are in other words really rewarded if you are a curious player and somewhat of a detective. The world is beautiful with awesome music.When I was nearing demigod nr. 3 I stopped to enjoy the view and the gorgeous music for a while.This is truly a masterpice and I hope people whom are not into the difficult and obscure games of From Software will give this a chance. The difficulty of these games are really the learning phase, but once you get the hang of them they are not a joy!The difficulty gives you a fealing of dread when you are venturing into the unknown, embrace it.I have been playing this game on PS5 and I have sometimes experienced fps drops when I am riding in forrest areas, but nothing that has been game breaking.",0,1

"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Truly an incredible experience. This game is a mix between the tightly crafted and rewarding challenging Souls formula we've come to know and love and a sprawling open world with secrets and discoveries everywhere. I was afraid this would break the mostly-linear design of From Software's previous classic entries but it only strengthens it in my book, adding an entirely new layer and showing a natural evolution to the formula.

You're let go almost instantly, with only a general pointer in the direction of the main story, but you'll quickly learn that rushing the bosses will be a grueling and punishing feat, encouraging exploration. While From Software, for some reason or another, still struggle with confusing UI and menu navigation for newcomers, this game is more beginner-friendly than ever before.

No more is the solution to encountering a hard boss to just keep trying again and again for hours. Now you can do something else. Empower your weapons, get significant new abilities and ashes and much much more, but most importantly: gain experience. There are also a ton of different playstyles available of different difficulties, so while there might now be a difficulty slider, the player can choose differing paths to get an easier or harder time with the game.

The story is pretty obscure, so unless you're willing to read and read and explore every corner of the world, don't expect to get a clear cut picture of the world you're in.

+ great music again
+ the legacy dungeons are mostly fantastic
negative
- i consider this as my biggest complaint: pls fromsoft if you can't come up with a new boss, DON'T re-use them or put 2 re-used bosses in 1 room. Just come up with something new or don't make them at all.
-  i said most legacy dungeons are good because i found raya lucaria to be disapointing, it looked awesome in the trailers but it was pretty small and did not come up with anything new.
- perfomance issues
I see a lot of unknowing people in the user reviews that give the game below a 7 , they clearly did not do any effort in looking features up, which is not even necessary because this game guides you enough if you read everything . But people are to lazy to read anyway . If you are reading this then bravo atleast you put some effort in reading this review :) . The only valid criticism you can give is the ones i listed and if you just don't like open world games which i understand.

I was worried they’d take a step back from the level design and world building approach we all have been so accustom to. I’m pleased to say I was wrong. The open world is a breath of fresh air and beast of its own. Over the 60+ hours I’ve put into the game so far I’ve had nothing but good times and whenever I put down my controller I immediately want to pick it back up again. It’s intoxicating and anxiety inducing all at once. The vistas, the swamps, the crumbled castles, the dungeons, the lighting and the atmosphere and more is jaw dropping. The world feels alive. The open world fatigue has been a problem for many years now but FROM has managed to take something familiar and make it unfamiliar. They have superseded my expectations in every way possible.

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Elden Ring is fascinating!
After getting my platinum for 70 hours, I can clearly say that this game is one of my favorite fromsoft games alongside with Bloodborne and Sekiro.
-Gameplay, is similar to Dark Souls 3, and have some ""must-have"" parts like jumping using only ONE button, and of course the Horse Torrent because of how big the world of the game is.Also kinda new thing is Ashes of War, but they just replace grindstones and gems from Dark Souls 3.
The world of this game is unusual to an open world standard, there 4 types of dungeons in this game:caves,catacombs,hero graves and tunnel and they are all interesting to investigate, and rewards with valuable resources.But for me open world in this game is the worst part of the game,but that doesn’t mean that it is bad, just mediocre, because of the confusion at the start of the game, when u can’t figure out where to go.Sometimes u can go to the high-level locations, and sometimes u can even get to the low-level location already being a high-level player.In my opinion they should’ve done a map layout by progression levels, for example like in Witcher 3.Beside this minus, the world of the game is really good and has an unique atmosphere.
-The main story of this game is one of the best stories from all games from this developer.Only bloodborne , in my opinion is better.Overall the whole conflict in the lands between is the best part of the games lore, all this castle with their opinion about the fracture of the Elden Ring, most of them where trying to take the whole power of the Elden Ring, and for example some folks like Rykard where interested in consuming all of the gods.But if think everyone must experience it, someone may like the lore and story of the game (like me), and some may don’t like.
-Main Bosses the game ( those who carry the shards of the Elden Ring ) are fascinating and unique to the whole Souls-like games.For example General Radahn, I’ve never experienced such an epic fight.All the friends you have met where helping you to fight Radahn, even Blaid with Alexander.Rykard is similar to Giant Yorm ( from DS3 ) and Storm Kings ( DeS ) but way harder than them , also fight is very good and fair.Morgott and Goodrick,Mohg are good but usual to the whole series, but also very ingesting.And the hardest one is Malenia, and god she’s though, the boss the heals himself and has 3 one-shot attacks in first phase, and 3 one-shot attacks in second, also she has 2 health bars.Yeah…that boss is really hard, and clearly the hardest boss in the game and of the hardest bosses from whole fromsoft games.Also the game has a lot of optional bosses : Dragonlord Placidusax (Two-headed Darkeater Midir :3 ), Hoarah Loux the Warrior ( the best boss music in the game ), Rennala Queen of the full moon ( second phase - huge flashback to Rom, the vacuous spider from Bloodborne ), Mimic Tear ( Basically You ), Maliketh ( he’s one not optional, but he look astonishingly beautiful), Regal &amp; Basic Ancestor Spirit ( very relaxing ost , and very good fight ), and so on… This game have a lot of bosses.
-The last thing I want to talk is graphics, and they are decent, not next-gen like in Demon Souls Remake, but not bad at all.
For me Elden Ring became a very interesting journey, with memorable bosses, deep lore, and beautiful locations.And after getting a platinum in this game I already miss it…

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Don't usually leave game reviews, but doing my part to combat the 0 scores that are being put up here constantly.

First of all this game isn't for everyone - much like most FromSoftware games aren't for everyone. I think all of us nerds alike always are intrigued by these games because of how amazing the worlds they are set are in. Dark High Fantasy and George RR Martin, how could people not want to jump in. Well, unfortunately for most getting a chance to run through these world, explore their secrets and dive into their lore is a dream they'll never fulfill because the right to do that isn't just handed to you - you have to earn it.

I think this rings the most true for Elden Ring and is why for the first 4-6 hours I wasn't having a good time with this game. For reference, I have beaten DS3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro prior to this but the start of this game felt wayyyyy harder than any of those. But then after getting my ass handed to me by Margit for the 7th time I decided to go exploring and stumbled upon Weeping Peninsula. After that - it's all she wrote I haven't been able to stop playing this game.

The open world aspect of Elden Ring is interesting to say the least - the way it is implemented reminds me a lot of Zelda: Twilight Princess from back in the day. Nothing really is guiding you outside of visual queues and some statues that will point you in the direction of caves and dungeons. This was very frustrating at first because I felt like I was running through a world with nothing to do on the surface level, but once you start to learn what to look for and how the game shows you where to go it really opens up.

The combat is really great - sure there are some broken hitboxes here and there and gank bosses still drive me to my greatest rage but man it's so satisfying to try different Ashes of War and break enemy's poise. The sheer variety of locations, secrets, weapons, quests, and replayability of this title will keep me playing for months on end. It really is a nice change of pace compared to modern open world games.

If you're struggling don't be afraid to find some guidance online even if it is ""spoiling"" your experience. If you quit at Margit and don't pick it up again there is no experience to spoil. Do what you gotta do.

Real rating is 8.5/10 for frame rate issues, massive pop in, and I think a lack of open world mechanic explanation in the beginning. Even though it's a FromSoft game a little more direction to like a trial dungeon or something of that nature would have been helpful for a lot of players.

If you can't stand this game then go play Ghost of Tsushima - it's a nice blend between Elden Ring's exploration style, traditional Open World exploration style, and a middle ground of difficulty and combat variety. But seriously, embrace being a Tarnished and struggle and claw to becoming an Elden Lord. It's always worth it.",0,0

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"If you are a fan of FromSoftware games and open-world RPGs Elden Ring is a dream. This game doesn't tell you what you NEED to do. You do what YOU want to do. Go where YOU want to go.

| highly recommend starting this game as a Wretch and not watching 100 videos about how to optimise the first levels or get the 'best' gear. Starting in this way makes the experience even more rewarding than it already is. You don't start with weapons that are already better than the first things you find. Everything is valuable, you adapt the way you play based on the things you find.

Compare it to games like Valheim or Runescape, you start those adventures with nothing, you get stronger as you explore.

If you are struggling on an area or boss you can leave and return when you feel stronger instead of feeling like you are required to do it like previous FromSoftware games. You will know when you aren't strong enough to proceed.

The first time you die to a boss, your first thought might be is this is literally impossible... 20 deaths later when you have learnt most of their attacks and he gets to half health you begin to believe. Then get hit by a second phase which makes it seem even more impossible. 40 deaths later getting to the second phase is now a cake walk and you wonder how you ever doubted yourself. Then its just about learning the rest of the mechanics and believing in your skills with a controller or M&amp;K. Finally when the boss falls... an overwhelming sense of accomplishment, and hopefully a huge item upgrade.

This is why Elden Ring is so rewarding and everyone who loves a gaming challenge as well as an awesome adventure through a brutal, unforgiving and mysterious world should test their skill and attempt to become.... the Elden Lord.",0,0

- The world is massive with a lot of things going around (Mobs, Secrets, Bosses etc.)
- Gameplay imho is the best one out of all the souls borne games, shields are useful in this game and not mention counter-guard is the OP attack second only to Jumping Attack which will help you beat a hard boss)
- Accessibility during boss fight is the most accessible out of all souls borne games, Marika statue existence completely remove the players on hassling all the way through the boss arena.
- The world is just simply amazing and a lot secrets might I add that will make you lose tons of hours of sleep just wanting to discover new places.
- Bosses while some speaking of mechanics are very similar to previous souls borne games but majority are rather fresh and are enjoyable not to mention even with the existence of Marika Statue that doesn't mean you won't be using that a lot as some bosses are still rather difficult.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,For me this is a strange one to review. I initially hated it but kept going and going until I got better. The beginning is the hardest part. By the end the boss’s were dropping first time and there is many OP builds you can make at any time. The fact there is co op for the boss’s too really doesn’t make this much of a challenge if you have someone  that’s good. As a game it is addicting as hell and I’ve got to give it credit for that. It’s got a few small performance issues but nothing too bad.  The story is non existent but the gameplay is so fun at times you don’t really care. It is Over hyped by critics and I think games like TLOU and horizon are way way better. But this was still pretty damn good.,0,0
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I give this game a 10 because it is the closest thing to ""my perfect game"" that I have ever played.

I loved the idea of an ""open world Dark Souls"" game, but it surpasses my expectations by leaps and bounds. Masterfully crafted world and lore, the best combat, move sets and magic of any ""Souls game"" so far, a wonderful sense of exploration and discovery... it's been a damn fun and compelling experience.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"You can pretty much ignore all the poor scores if they mention technical issues, because not only are they already halfway fixed after a day, they really weren't that bad to begin with.The game itself might be as close to a perfect game as mankind can get. You are given a horse to explore this souls like world, but you will barely have time to ride it because there is just so much stuff to explore. I have found myself saying ""ok I will just ride to that town I've been heading to all day."" But about thirty seconds into my ride I see a tomb door enticing me inward. The result is I spend the next hour fighting through some underground level to fight a boss and take am ash of war or a special item or a weapon.And this exact thing happens a lot, each time the enemies are totally different, the boss is totally unique and the loot feels well earned.Not only is the game addicting but it looks amazing. Sometimes I actually have to stop and just look at the scenery. The textures are a bit dated, as they are with all Fromsoftware games, but the ambiance and lighting totally steel the show and you entirely forget about dates textures. The questing system is by far the best I have ever seen in an open world game or From game. Sometimes you will be exploring and find a random NPC who will just have a few dialogue options and it seems like nothing important. But in reality, that NPC as a hidden side quest that is triggered by giving them an item and ultimately unlocks a major function of upgrading. Or else grants you a very powerful weapon. People who say the game is boring either haven't played a souls game and thus don't understand how to find secrets in these games, or are too quick to judge and didn't actually spend time doing anything besides slapping dudes as a hero.That's the next big thing in this game, the character creation is even more open than ever. If you played DS3 and wished for better magic and faith options you're in luck, they have been massively enhanced this time around and playing a mixed build for say faith and strength is a bit more interesting now.Don't trust 0/10, this game is probably the best game of the souls genre and a very very good game in general.",0,0

"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"If you liked any of the Fromsoft games starting with Demon's Souls you'll love it. If you didn't, then perhaps Elden Ring is not for you. While it is more forgiving than some of FS's previous titles, it's still a ""souls"" game... Be ready to spend hours trying to figure out enemy's movement patterns and die a lot. If this does not sound appealing then again, this game is not for you.

What differs it from previous games is the world, which is not only open but manages to avoid the ubisoft formula. There are very few icons on the world map marking locations, and they only pop up once a location is discovered. There is no filler in the shape of find-all-flags or collect-all-logs and so on. There are no objective markers, a journal, quest log, character dossiers, collectibles etc. You are expected to pay attention to what NPC's are asking you to do, often indirectly and often in passing. I found this refreshing, as most games these days seem to be going out of their way to force you to experience everything they have to ofter, and they will remind you of the things you haven't, every time you open a map. When you discover a new location in ER, it's your discovery, rather than an inevitable stop on a theme park ride prepared by the devs. I liked it, would recomend it to a friend.",0,0

The scope of this game is nuts. There's so many enemies  and so much creativity in the open world. the art design is a masterpiece.

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"After playing 50 hours, I can say that i still have a lot to discover, the gameplay is really solid with a lot of different ways to confront any situation, the story it's such a complex drama with a lot of political, lovecraftean and magical aspects, you can feel the tension between all the many different npcs, everyone is trying to use you, or taking adventage of the situation to reach their own goals, they feel really alive, and at the end you'll have to take a decission, very few games can manage to create that feeling of weight on your decissions, now, all that is complemented with a brilliant world building, the lore is really deep, and it truly makes you question some aspects you see, just to discover later than things aren't like they seemed at the beginning, that there's more dept into it, about the audiovisual aspect, it's excellent, some people may complain that there isn't 16k textures, that demon's souls remake looks better, would have been better if it was done on unreal and stuff, can't blame them, but all that is eclipsed by the art direction, the game has an unique asmoshpere, it's truly beautiful, the draw distance is huge, and everything you see, you can go there, and truly, the map is **** big, and all that, done without loosing the art direction quality, there's a place that you get teleported after ""x"" chest, and when you see it, it's just beautiful, the music causes so many feelings, from the majestuosity, to the melancholy of the place, the scale of everything, makes you feel that your character is in a odissey, soemthing to take note off, is that Elden Ring is a way different than any other from game to date, it's a dying world but, it's a way more alive than any soulsborne to date, and the feeling you get through playing makes you feel heroic, rather than sad or melancholic, the music helps a lot on that, there has been a really clear evoltion on how they composed the music, it works to give you that feeling of heroism, to defeath your enemies and become the legendary Elden Lord that everyone has told you to become, this game will be very subjective for a lot of people, in summary, the game is amazing and causes a lot of feelings on the player while more this one gets involved into the story and the world itself, if your major complain is just the graphics, then you should go for any other deadworld game with beautiful 3d models with not personality, with hundred of things telling you to pick this or this, just being guided like a sheep, and i don't blame them, but imo, the game is a masterpiece, has been years since i've seen such an alive world, with so many content, that gives you so many freedom, and with such a rich story and such a beautiful world writing, as videogames developer, is something that I would aspire to reach.
About the preformance, IMO, any problem is eclipsed by what i said before.

Con un minimo di pratica è un gioco che diventa alla portata di tutti, e quando impari non puoi più smettere. Aggiungerei, che nel marasma di open world tutti uguali, enormi e vuoti, con secondarie identiche, stesse meccaniche da Ubisoft ripetute fino al vomito e quant'altro, questo titolo si distingue eccome. Nessun punto della mappa è uguale ad un altro, i nemici hanno tutti un peso nella trama, ogni cosa ha un perché, il design è straordinario sia per mostri che per ambientazione. Unica nota dolente del titolo è il lato tecnico, non è un titolo next gen, ma con un comparto artistico del genere non pesa proprio per nulla. In conclusione, per chi non è avvezzo ai souls questo potrebbe essere un buon punto di partenza, essendo più semplice dei precedenti giochi From, ed avendo un open world ammaliante, per chi invece è avvezzo, questo titolo è un vero parco giochi, una evoluzione straordinaria che la saga meritava!",0,0

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Elden Ring is great! As a recent fan of FromSoft titles it was really cool to be part of a community that’s so involved with these games. The reason I gave it a 10/10 is because it took all the best parts of all their other games and put it into an open world environment. Having an idea of what you’re supposed to accomplish in any video game is vital to how you enjoy this game. For me I am at the beginning and I can say that I truly feel like player progression is making my player who starts out without many skills to now having the tools I need to win battles. I look forward to where I end up in the lands between but I know that I will find at the end of my journey a desire to come back and do it all over again.,0,0
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Ignore the review bombs being thrown around here. This game is really something special and is a once in a lifetime type of game. That statement is not hyperbole.  This game is a stone cold masterpiece and for some reviewers to claim that the developers were lazy in crafting it is absolutely absurd. The story, map, characters, enemies, and bosses have all been masterfully designed to provide an unmatched experience of adventuring through a hostile fantasy land. I am playing on an Xbox Series S and the game looks fantastic and has not had any performance issues whatsoever. I am very picky about what games I occupy my time with and the more I play this, the mote I realize this may be to date, the greatest video game of all time.",0,0

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Remember the date 11.11.11? Skyrim launched with a massive Fus Ro Dah! and hell it became a staple of the open world RPGs of that time.
Well 22.02.2022 (ok I know, 3 days later) marks the beginning of a new era! Elden Ring will have the same effect on the genre as Skyrim did all those years ago.
No game has managed to immerse me so deeply since Skyrim.
Elden Rings Lands Between are carefully handcrafted, brimming with secrets, which it tries its best to hide from you as best as possible. Persistent exploration is the only mend.
The visuals are stunning, the performance on PS5 is excellent.
One of the best games I have ever played, must stop now, must get back to playing it",0,0
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"FromSoftware is a very unique developer that has always walked a narrow path, and as we can see today, gamers have always loved it. Although I never made it through any of the other games they have done, I am finding Elden Ring quite refreshing. The game doesn't hold your hand or tell you where to go. You have to figure out this all by yourself, and that is indeed a big strength.

The biggest challenge is to overcome your own frustration, when you do, you are rewarded.

I recommend it. Playing on the PS5.",0,0

Of course, like most reviews you see, the FPS drops can be a bit of a problem if you play on PC, but on PS5 There are rarely FPS drops, and if there are they aren't noticeable. The bosses are fun to beat and also give you satisfaction when you beat them. Everything in this game is amazing.  10/10

"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I am by no means a Soulsborne veteran. I mean I olayed several of the FS games but I am not a pro or someone who gets REALLY deeply into them.That being said, for a casual gamer this FS game is the nost fun and accessible.It is still challenging, but I really enjoy that if something is way too hard at the moment, you can just do something else.This way the game is far less frustrating and repetitive.Exploration is rewarding, this is the first FS game shere I really discover every nook and cranny of fhe map.One thing I still cannot get used to is the style of storytelling. Especially in the terms of very obscure story events. Talk 3 times to an NPC to unlock. A dialogue option, do things in weird soecific order, otherwise the NPC dies, etc.I am not saying it is bad, it's just not my cup of tea.But all in all it is a very solid game, I really like thay you can approach battles with different tactics.

The game doesn't hold your hand. It vaguely tells you where to go next. There are clues spread around the map randomly about interesting places. Exploration is nearly always worthwhile. As for the ""soulsborne"" aspect, combat is solid and more forgiving then in past titles. I love being able to refill flasks from certain mobs or clearing out packs of mobs. Co-op is the easiest it has been in a From Soft title ever. My only real negative and it isn't huge is the lack of haptic usage for the PS5 Dual Sense controller. Sure it vibrates, but really want to use the controller to it's fullest. Hopefully a patch will fix that.",0,0

The goal of this game is not to rush through the main path, but to explore the beautiful and HUGE open world with its‘ secrets and side content. I have played for 78 hours now and have beaten 4 major Bosses and i still have a lot to discover. Gameplay is also just 10/10 with its‘ variety auf playstyles und different Bosses.

Other than that, the game, aside from some performance issues on PC which I'm sure will be fixed, this game is fantastic. Amazing aesthetic, music, bosses, armor, weapons. Lots of things to do and a massive, and I mean MASSIVE open world. Every place feels unique with every area offering different enemies and challenges to overcome.

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I have about 50 hours into the game so far and I’m about halfway through. And I’ve missed a LOT of content. I went into this game with unreasonably high expectations and they’ve been met or exceeded across the board. This game is so insanely massive while also rewarding you the more you look, so the world feels far from empty. 9/10 if you see something and think “I wonder if that leads somewhere/does something” it does and it will.Combat, like all fromsoft, titles is fantastic. When you combine ashes of war with the new crafting system or countless spells/items you have a lot of opportunity to create really unique combinations. While bosses can feel unfair the first time you fight them they NEVER are, they’re balanced perfectly so when you defeat them you actually feel like you’ve accomplished something. Also, you can just go and do any dungeon or explore completely (ridiculously large) optional places to build xp and make any fight easier.The world design is fantastic. The map gives you clues as to the direction to go in order to get to an important boss or follow the main path but other than that you are left on your own to find the way. And god how refreshing it is to not have your hand held every single step of the way and to actually just figure it out for yourself.I’ve seen users complaining about performance issues but I haven’t had any so far, no crashes or obvious frame drops (PS5). I’ve also seen users complaining about graphics which I really don’t understand because it has great graphics, just not “next-gen”. But, for me, artistic design will always have more impact than graphical fidelity.I don’t want to talk much about the story yet as I’m still putting all of it together and I don’t want to spoil anything but I’ll just conclude this by saying this: this is my favorite video game ever, and I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface.",0,0
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring is the end of a path that from Software Started in 2009. After several  years and 6 games of exsperimentations they took the best from each of their previous works and they mixed those characteristics with a beautiful exploration based open world(mainly inspired by  Breath of the Wild). The amount of content and its density is great. Every corner of the world (and under-world) map hides a new challenge and a new mystery to resolve. The art direction and lore is brilliant and we have to thank not only  H. Miyazaki but also the American writer George R.R. Martin. I also recommend this game to fans of Shadow of the Colossus since in some zones you are going to experience similar feelings. As you can imagine from my previous statements the gameplay is the culmination of souls-like and the definition of a well-made, deep and articulated combat system that barely any videogame has. The game has some clear problems like the recycle of assets and some technical issue but if you overcome this minor issues and let the world of The Lands Between steal your attention you will be rewarded.",0,0

I do want Fromsoft to make another Bloodborne or Darksouls game (more linear) to scratch that itch for a tight, dark, intertwined experience. Elden Ring takes the best aspects from all of their previous work and combines them to make an outstanding game, however it isn’t a better Darksouls game than Darksouls. It isn’t a better Bloodborne game than Bloodborne (if that makes sense). Overall, this game rocks and I hope everyone gets a chance to experience it.",0,0
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I am new to FromSoftware titles. From the outside looking in I always thought they looked slow, boring, and too difficult. Once I jumped into Bloodborne, the premise and gameplay loop clicked and I understood why people loved them so much. Elden Ring takes this challenging, yet rewarding, gameplay loop and puts it into a beautiful and massive open world with endless things to go and explore and witness. There are countless epic moments you’ll come across that’ll leave your jaw on the floor. For fans of this genre this game is something really magical that’ll bring enjoyment for years to come. I understand that this game appeals to a niche audience and it’s sad to see that it’s getting review bombed by people outside the genre or people upset with the high scores who just don’t get it. In a similar way, I’m bored to death playing Mario games or Racing Sims, yet I understand those games are not for me so I’m not out there critically reviewing a game I’m not the audience for. I hate call of duty games but I don’t go review bomb them. People really need to grow up and learn to say “this game isn’t for me.” And leave it at that instead of giving it a ridiculous 0/10.

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Let’s just get one thing out of the way. This game is not revolutionary, nor propels the open world genre forward. I don’t think it’s worth a 10 rating but it’s a pretty amazing game. Reviews are after all just opinions made by humans. Now with that out of the way. People review bombing the game while nothing new should really stop. Do you think this game is truly awful? Have you ever actually played an awful and broken game? Apparently not if you think this deserves a 0-4 etcDo I think the game has some issues? Yes particularly when it comes to performance. Honestly the game would get a 10 rating if FromSoftware innovated more, or changed up their formula by adding more variety to their games.The game at its core is still fighting and traps. Where are the inventive puzzles to break the monotony? Gave us a jump button but really didn’t make much use for it besides combat.Honestly I think they are afraid to change up the formula because their last game Sekiro, which was amazing sold less than DS3 and the Dark Souls fanatics are apparently addicted to the same thing.Also to add on to the performance issues the fact that this game has pop-in, and frame rate issues on PS5 or any other version is embarrassing to say the least. The game isn’t pushing any graphical boundaries and is devoid of shadows in tons of areas particularly indoors. Watching a bat flap it’s wings in the distance looking like a stuttering mess is a sight to behold. If I didn’t like the game I would score it lower on these factors.",0,0

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,Absolutely addicted to this game. This en captures the definition of adventure. The discovery of events supports that. And the action to land ratio is near perfect. Now some people say it is hard to know where to go in comparison to previous souls games. Which imo this game does not lack in that aspect. This game tells you where to go in many ways. For instance npc’s tell you critical information. If you for some reason don’t talk to npc’s ever. Then the sites of grace will tell you where to go on the map. This game’s art design is stunning. The overall game is the best game I’ve ever played.,0,0

Cons: With the lore being interesting, I wish there were at least some cutscenes, so that they could present a powerful story. Also, many of the bosses didn't seem as memorable as in their Dark Souls games.",0,0
"Mar 21, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,5,"Yet another Souls game. For better or worse, mostly just the same.

Yep it's a Souls game with a poorly developed open world tacked on, has some repetitive dungeons with  minibosses sprinkled around with poor rewards and repeated mechanics.

No real advancement to the series, just the same old with a lot of empty, uninteresting (even if pretty) stretches of open world added on.

More troll cheese from the devs, some baffling unbalanced bosses, etc.

If you liked the previous entries in the de facto serial franchise.. you might like this one... just don't expect anything beyond what came before.

The worst part is that this is a full price, supposedly AAA, game and the graphics look like they're from 7 years ago, the PC performance is inexcusably bad and LOCKED TO 60 FPS. The menus are still a mess to navigate.

If this weren't by FromSoft people would be **** on it left and right and raging at the company for releasing an half baked product. Alas, sheeps will baa and follow the herd

Las nuevas mecánicas cómo el salto y el combate a caballo (que si bien ya existían desde hace mucho tiempo en los videojuegos, mas elden ring los utiliza de modo excepcional) funcionan fe forma increíble, y abren un gran abanico de posibilidades tanto a la movilidad cómo a la exploración o al combate, ya que están muy bien aprovechadas. Sin ir mas allá, solo las magias, cosa que ya existía en todos los juegos de Dark Souls, aquí se sienten totalmente distintas. Son ágiles y útiles y jugar cómo mago realmente genera una sensación satisfactoria, no porque vuelva el juego fácil, sino porque realmente te sientes un mago en un reino de fantasía.
Y hablando de la dificultad. Mucho se habló de que iba a ser un juego más fácil, con mas ayudas, etc... Bueno, Gilip*lleces. Es igual de dificil o más que cualquier otro juego de From.

Why can't from soft just allow people to play together consistently, this isn't 10 years ago where this was acceptable, the network is broken and co-op is just a pain in the ass.

Over the years being a huge souls fan, i've been lenient with From Soft and hoped they would improve upon many things but they refuse particularly because reviewers are too nice to them. They deserve criticism not 10's.

Anyways, this feels like dark souls 3 but open world, the world is made well but this is not innovative and feels samey.

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Absolutely the best game I have ever played in my life, hands down. Expect a challenge if your new to the Soulsbourne games, the difficulty is way over exaggerated, and the game gives you the tools to make it easier if you need, and there is so much freedom that you can always just move to a different area to if your stuck, and can come back after you’ve leveled up. Early game is always hard for new players, until you level up, get the gear you like and find your flow. But once you learn the flow the game is not “insanely hard” at all. It’s a deep game, but that’s why it’s so rewarding. Don’t expect much hand holding, this game won’t lead you around on a leash like others. But that’s the beauty, and what makes you feel like your on actual adventure. Instead of just watching cutscene after cutscene, being told where to go and what to do and how to do it.  You will have to actually think some. There is no quest log.  You will die, but you will overcome. You will find your way. And if you need help, there is a whole giant community ready to tell you to “Git gud” no really tho as long as your not whiny, people will help and guide you with WHATEVR you need. Just don’t show up crying or complaining that this games is trash. Show your resolve and determination, you will get respect and all the help you need. Not about being good, it’s about not being a baby. It’s about understanding these games are about the adventure, not the “difficulty”. This game sets out and perfectly nails what it’s trying to do. It’s not about just being hard, it never has. It’s about exploration, the journey, the atmosphere, the adventure. The hardship and overcoming it to become beast mode. Then you start wrecking dudes, until you get comfortable and come up against an enemy who only SEEMS insanely hard at first, and get destroyed. But you rise and come back to overcome.  The performance has been ifffy for some. I’m on Ps5 and get an occasional small frame drop but for me that’s it, and even still I can’t imagine playing anything else right now, performance be damned. It’s worse for others granted, but that will get fixed. I never thought these games would be for me, I didn’t like “hard just be hard” games, until I actually finally played through one, and it clicked, and now after playing all of fromsoftware games from DeS, I understand the diehards. This is easily their magnum opus, a love letter to Fromsoft fans, but also anyone wanting to experience the FS formula for the first time.   Don’t believe the negative posts that don’t relate to performance. Some games just aren’t for some people, doesn’t make them bad games. Being mad at performance is understandable, game breaking to some, but rest assure that once it is, you will understand why everyone who’s been able to play it before release has been giving it a 10/10.  THANK YOU FROMSOFT!!!! You have done your fans proud, and we hope for a fix to the Performance issues so that no one will have any excuse to not play this game. Time will tell and I’m not worried about it success in the long run. So peace out, Im not a writer and have been ranting long enough, I’m heading back to The Lands Between on my magistical horned stead to stand beneath the Erdtree and make my claim. And I truly hope those who are having a difficult time with performance a speedy recovery so you can join in jolly cooperation!",0,0

"Feb 26, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"The ultimate Dark Souls open world expierence, it's definitely captured my heart since I've been a fan of these games since 2013, performance isn't as bad as most of the review bombers are saying unless they're on older consoles, on PS5 I've had a constant 60 FPS and after a recent patch one day after release I've had no stuttering either. Elden Ring will definitely be a game that's talked about years and years from now, it's absurdly beautiful with a lot to do in the open world, it's still a great challenge but with minor safety nets such as checkpoint like items right before a big boss fight or tough area that let's you respawn closer to the area if you die, accessibility without lowering difficulty overall. If you like dark souls in anyway what do ever you'll fall on love with Elden Ring.",0,0
"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Review bombing made me feel compelled to share my two cents. So far, I’m loving the game. I’ve clocked 20+ hours and think it’s been an exciting expansion from prior iterations in the Soulsbourne series. That said, Soulsbourne games aren’t for everyone. Most of the people who review this highly tend to love this genre already. I am one of those people. These are my favorite games, without a doubt. When I see reviews panning the game for graphics and minor frame rate stutter, I can’t help but think that these reviewers were kind of bound to not like these games. These games are not about graphics. They aren’t about a tight, neat story. This is a game focused on an exceptionally refined combat system vs. some of the most thoughtfully designed hurdles to overcome with that combat system. The result is, to me, the most rewarding games I’ve ever played. If that sounds like your cup of tea, you’ll love this game.",0,0

"Mar  1, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring is the best game I have played in at least ten years, maybe ever. Gameplay wise it is exactly what I expected and wished for. It is the combination of every good gameplay aspect of earlier souls games. You can roam freely in an open world in which every region feels and looks immensly different from the other regions. These regions are filled with content as well. I have come back to earlier regions and almost always found a new dungeon or a new npc. While not every small corner in this world is filled with items or general secrets, you still get rewarded for exploration, but in a slightly broader scale than in the earlier From Software titles.

Now performance:

This game is currently being review bombed by people for multiple reasons. Mostly the performance on PC. It is only day 3 so I am certain that these issues will be fixed soon, especially with a company like From Software, who is always trying to listen to the community. Nevertheless, these issues do not suddenly turn this beautifully breathtaking game to a 0 points. Do not listen to these people. Whenever a big majority of people enjoy a game, other people start hating on this game because they want to be different. Please do not let yourself be influenced by them.",0,0

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I want to start off by addressing many of the 0-4 star reviews. I question these peoples credibility because many of them are rating the game low because of the graphics. I’ve read many reviews where it starts off with “the graphics are…!” Now, I don’t know about you, but how credible is a reviewers opinion on a game when their sole focus is the graphics? One review literally said they gave the game a lower score simply to balance out the hype. I would argue that their credibility is of the lowest quality. While graphics are not “mind blowing,” the game more than makes up for it with the structure of the open world and gameplay. The open world feels organic; there are no markers that highlight important areas. If you want to find weapons, secret dungeons, bosses, etc., you have to explore and find those things yourself. The game does not hold your hand and tell you what to do. The environments are structured in a such a way that it draws your attention, but, at the end of the day, you must be the one to go out and explore the world to find it’s treasures. I’ve ran into so many caves and dungeons form just simply trying to get from point A to point B and being side tracked by something looking interesting in the distance. The combat, while very similar to Dark Souls, feels responsive and fluid. Enemies are not necessarily difficult, but rather intelligent; they try to bait you to attack early so that you make a mistake. The game demands that you consciously react to enemies and not simply panic dodge or attack for the sake of button mashing. Once you understand that, the combat clicks and even the pace of combat speeds up, as you dodge between enemy attacks, counter with your own attack, parry, jump attack, and create spacing/ close distances. There are a wide range of basic enemies and an even more diverse set of bosses which will truly test your ability to think in combat. The story is true to Fromsoftware; it is vague and obscured. It is up to the player to piece the events of the world together. If you are all about the story in a game, then I can understand some frustration here, but if you are a fan of other From titles, then you know exactly what you are getting.Overall, the game is fantastic. They have crafted an open world that is fun to explore while not being a chore to do so. From has tuned their combat system to a T. It might not be for everyone, especially those that simply want to button mash and not think about their actions during combat; or those that become angered and enraged by dying to enemies. But for long time fans of the other titles, this is a must play.",0,0

La propia exploración es lo que hace a su vez que aunque sea dificil el juego no se haga un martirio imposible de llevar.

In the current state of the game due to stuttering and fps drops and save issues it is a 7/10. I have high hope and I am positive they will fix it. I am on ps5 so I am enjoying the game with very little issues.My problems with the actual game:-Can’t swim(don’t matter that much)-slight smudgy looking objects when too far awayWhat’s good with the game:-Stunning art style and environment-Amazing as usual bosses and characters -improved and adaptive bosses to change according to how you play-Cool gear-Interesting lore and story -great music and sound-Random encounters and being teleported and feeling overwhelmed with greatness when u get thrown in random locationsThe people complaining about graphics or the way combat is have never touched a from software game in their life. This is how they are. The combat changes on what weapons or magic u have. The combat is good in this game for a from software. Also these games graphics are known to be unique. The art style and environment is what makes them beautiful and they didn’t disappoint here. You can have your complaints but giving it a 0 not even due to the technical issues is just the dumbest **** ever.

"Feb 27, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"People rating this game lower than a 8 wouldn’t know good game design if it but them right in their tarnished. I saw one review saying “the open world lacks any creativity”. Compared to what? I can’t think of a single other piece of any medium, movie, game, music or otherwise, with as much strange, gross and abstract creativity as this game. I’ve seen people down there saying, “the open world is empty, and lacks in quality”, saying that camps are randomly splayed out with enemies. Did you play the game for more than an hour? Judging by the fact that you posted your review an hour after the game came out I’m gunna guess no. I’ve never seen an open world game have so many different types of enemies interesting npcs with mysterious side quests they don’t just waypoint you to, crazy enemy battles, and as hugely diverse set of locations as this game. And camps and castles always have an item in them that will help you, and you’ll need it because this game is still challenging as all hell. Or, the outposts and camps will have a weapon which are so far and few between in this game, every time you find one you get hype. That’s called pacing nerds. Bad graphics, ok who gives a **** Gameplay over graphics any day, and besides that the visuals are absolutely gorgeous because of the beautiful art design. As far as FPS drops go, yes this is a valid criticism. I’ve been around several people that have had bad fps issues and crashes. I would rate the game lower than a 10 if I had experienced any of these personally. As far I’m concerned this is one of the best open world games ever made.

For those that say combat feels ""clunky"" - I assume they have no idea what equipment load does in game. If you are fast rolling the combat feels as fast as Bloodborne.

It does take a good amount of time to get good at the game and understand the combat mechanics. At the start, it's going to feel like you're never going to be able to kill anything other than trash. But if you keep at it and invest your runes and ashes wisely, you'll be rewarded.
I've played games that are huge open worlds but the actual playable area is small and you get nothing for exploring except nice views. Elden Ring gives you the nice view and has rewards to go with it. I love that you can always across caves or a bandit camps with plenty of loot. The game is harsh but also rewarding!
This is definitely a buy from me! Except if you're someone who prefers games that get to the point from the start and are mission focused. This game can be vague and you need to put in the grind to get ahead. This is the open in open world.",0,0

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Dark Souls + Breath of The Wild = Elden Ring. If that sounds like fun to you, then you'll love this game. There's too much good in here for the bad to bring this game to a solid 8. I'd give this game an 8.8 if I could.

The Bad: Occasional frame drops in prioritize graphics mode (I only noticed two in 60 hours of gameplay so far so I changed to prioritize frame rate and haven't had an issue since). One of the most detailed character creators to date, however Dark souls type graphics limit what it could be. Multiplayer needs to be updated with some quality fixes. There are occasionally cheap deaths like rooms filled to the brim with hidden enemies. My big gripe is commands in combat should NOT stack especially in a game where a split second decision can mean life or death. It's annoying when the player character does a command you wanted to do 3 seconds ago which is a lot of time in a boss fight. Lastly, I'm reading that a-lot of the enemies are taken from other Souls games and thrown into this one, but i've only played DS1 and Sekiro so it hasn't been a noticeable issue for me. However, these are all nitpicks in what has been an otherwise fantastic experience.

The Good: The world is massive, beautiful, and there is so much content that I'm only 16% completed 60 hours in. Enemy variety is unbelievable; No game I've played has even come close to having this many types of enemies. The bosses are tough but (mostly) fair. The game heavily rewards players who explore with better weapons, armor, mechanics and obviously extra levels. If you think you can just run through the main story without exploring you'll get destroyed. Weapon variety is outstanding. There are so many different ways to fight especially with the ashes of war system, which will lead to lots of replay value. Elden Ring is subjectively the easiest FromSoftware game to date (though some players think it's impossible), however the combat is still very challenging and will keep you on your toes any time you venture to a new area. The lore building is fantastic and interesting. There's a sense of wonder that I haven't felt since Skyrim. While the non hostile npcs are few and far between each one is unique and feel important to the games themes and story. Especially since you can summon these npcs in pivotal boss fights. The game makes me want to explore every little thing and I normally skip a lot of side content but the side content in this game almost feels like part of the main story.

For players having trouble, if you get stuck on a boss for over an hour that is your queue to leave go out, explore, find better items and level up. Some players review bombing this game don't seem to grasp this concept. I'm not a great souls player and only played DS1 and Sekiro but I beat Margit on my 4th try and Godrick on my 1st. Use summon signs to help you I really don't understand why so many people are rage quitting the game and then crying online ""game bad too hard"" because of these bosses. You don't even have to be good you can just over level if you have to which is very easy to do if you go out of your way to explore the world. Sure it takes time, but this is a massive game it's meant to take a while to finish. At the very least look at a guide on how to build your character to your strengths it only takes one google search. Also, PC reviewers need to stop review bombing the PS5 version. We get it, the PC port has lots of issues. I can't say the same for PS5. Overall this game has been superb. It's not a 10/10 masterpiece like the critics say, but it's very very good . 8.8/10",0,0

But I’ve only experienced that maybe a handful of times when the screen if chock full of enemies and a lot of special effects… is unfortunate, but FromSoft are onto it. I believe any PS5 player who says it’s unplayable is bs. I’ve watched streamers on pc have full frame lockups during boss battles.Actual review time.I’ve played demon souls a handful of times, currently struggling with blood borne, and finally getting good at sekiro, never actually finished a dark souls though, use to get way to mad and never pick up the titles again.I won’t lie, Elden Ring? She hits hard as well, punishing at worst. But maybe I’ve just grown up a little but I find so much joy in the challenge, and once I overcome that one guy who’s been wiping the floor with me, I feel I stoppable until I meet his cousin 30 seconds later I’ll walk up on a boss and have my ass beat. But that okay, I’ll level up and come back later, that is how this game is meant to be played, Margit, the first boss will beat your ass unless you chose a ranged/sorcery class and build upon it. Go explore the world, it truly is amazing, but not perfect. Nearly everything you can see I’ve virtually every vista is touchable, apart from water, tarnished sink like halo Spartans. There are fun enemy’s and characters peppered everywhere, some don’t come out until a specific time of day, The graphics, this ain’t no horizon forbidden west, but you shouldn’t have expected that, graphics is not what souls/borne is about, the mechanics and gameplay with a flood of wacky characters and lore….. and death. I’m running performance mode, on ps5 on a 4K hdr tv. And i can say with confidence it IS an upgrade from all previous in visuals, especially in the effects and animations. All others compare it to The Demon Souls remake, but that’s not a fair comparison, that was made by a seperate dev team, under supervision of Sony, making A CONSOLE LAUNCH TITLE! Of course it will be stunning, and take full advantage of the hardware and software, it was a software flex for Sony. As well as a faithful REMAKE of a cult classic by another team.Overall, Elden Ring has been a blast, and I’m only like 18% completed. If you enjoy the souls genre, get it, and play it, if you need to wait for patches, then do so. It will still be worth it. 9/10, due to the performance hiccups, and only time will let if the entry becomes a 10/10, a true cult classic.",0,0

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"I'm a fan of Fromsoft games, so I'm biased. I waited with great anticipation for this game for nearly 4 years since its announcement, and my high hopes and expectations were not just met but exceeded. These games are not for everyone, and Elden Ring is not an exception just because it's open-world. But for me, I'd infinitely prefer a game like Elden Ring over something like Assassin's Creed (No hate, just not for me). To me, this is the closest thing to the perfect ARPG out there - my only complaints are with the performance issues on PC. Unstable framerate, crashes, and invisible enemies in the open world - I've experienced all of these and they're not so minor as to not deserve scrutiny. I only docked 1 point for these issues because the rest of the game is so strong to me, and offers such a colossal amount of content, that I want to express how good the actual game is at a glance.",0,0
"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"It is a very good game. However, if you don't understand what you're getting into with a FromSoftware game, DO NOT BUY IT!! It is a DIFFICULT game that is not going to hold you hand and tell you exactly what to do. Unfortunately, Many people bought this game without understanding what it was and thinking you would just be flying around on dragons and obliterating enemies.

If you want a game that requires you to THINK and OVERCOME CHALLENGE, this is the game for you. However, if you want a game with quest markers, repetitive side content, and easy combat where you can just turn your brain off and screw around in an open world (not that there is anything wrong with that), you will be SEVERELY DISSAPOINTED!!",0,0

But holy sh*t, is this game good! The open world, the lore you have to discover by yourself and so much more make Elden Ring the ultimate Souls game. To everyone saying that there is no story and too little explanation on what to do: You are most likely new to this series and that’s why you need to take yourself some time to understand the games mechanics and lore properly. The game may be considered as an open world rpg, but since it is so different from other games of that category, it fits itself into a whole new subgenre that might feel weird to people who are not familiar to the Souls series. That’s why it’s important to get familiar with it to truly enjoy the experience Elden Ring has to offer.",0,0
"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Absolutely a genre-defining game. It's sad seeing so much vitriol around the game simply because of its warranted critical success, especially from clear review bombers. I'm not going to discredit any legitimate criticism, but for me this game exemplifies a gaming genre that I find most fulfilling. Full disclosure that I'm only roughly 40 hours into my journey (I say ""only"" because I haven't even gotten to the second legacy dungeon yet), but it's been a glorious journey thus far full of mystery, intrigue and exploration. As a massive fan of Bloodborne, Sekiro and Dark Souls 3, my expectations for this game were sky high and thus far every expectation has been passed. I think one underrated thing (based on some of the review bombing happening here) is that FromSoft excels at art-direction and experiential gameplay. Does this game have the best graphics or fidelity ever? No, of course not. But when we think about video game as a source of art, those are just two criterium in a vast amount of characteristics that make video games special. Elden Ring exemplifies what makes risk-reward balance in gaming so exciting, and how self-direction and exploration give the players freedom to be punished, rewarded and often times a mix of both, rather than being handheld to growth and points of interest. The game's art direction is incredible, giving life and depth to the open world. Additionally, the legacy dungeon I encountered exemplifies the best in FromSoft level design, showcasing intricacy and careful design without bloat nor oversimplification. There are a lot of mechanics that might confuse or bewilder new players. I encourage everyone who is willing to enjoy this game to its full potential to push themselves to learn enemy move sets, try new strategies and embrace the learning experience. You may not enjoy, but in most cases you'll love the FromSoft game paradigm as much as I did and want to play every game from the developer!",0,0

"Feb 28, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"In a world of where most large game studios choose to sacrifice quality material and respect to their community over next gen-updates and high performance, FromSoftware stand out. This isn’t a game about delivering a next generation cutting edge graphical evolution from its predecessors, but rather a game about continuing to evolve from the formula that made From successful and implementing new and big ideas to their core mechanics.It’s true the game doesn’t hold hands and isn’t trying to be accessible to everyone, but their past work has never been about that. It’s also true that the game has issues with frame drops on some platforms and doesn’t always look perfect, but for what it achieves and what it’s trying to do in a world this large more than makes up for some issues which are sure to be fixed. FromSoftware could have chosen to make another large open world with weak and uninteresting dialogue, repetitive and boring exploration with the same mechanics we’ve seen in every single other game for the last decade or two, or focused on incredible graphics and unfulfilling gameplay that is safe but accessible, however, they chose to stay true to their core community and expand on what has been working for them. The original Zelda games don’t hold up in todays world because of their graphics, it’s because of the love and care put into creating the world. It’s about the feeling you get when you achieve something after completion. It’s about dedicating time and experiencing the world you are playing in. It’s sad to see so many complaints about how games look these days when those are things that have never really mattered at the end of the day, it’s about the immersion and feeling the games bring.",0,0

The most time it’s taken me to run back to a boss is about 30 seconds and those instances are few and far between which makes dying to hard bosses way less frustrating and tedious.All things said, Elden ring is an amalgamation of all from soft games so far thrown into an open world which feels as dense as it is wide.",0,0

The gameplay is a super well-tuned dark souls. I have spent 27h and only reached the second area of the world.

Every single criticism of this game is invalid other than the FPS issues, but FromSoftware is going to fix that soon. The world is breathtaking, the graphics are good (despite what the HFW fans are spamming in the reviews), the gameplay is fluid and perfects what other games in the series have not.The story is more immersive and accessible than any other Souls title. The world is the most accessible as well, because if you’re stuck on something you can go literally anywhere else on the gigantic map with so much to explore. All character builds are viable so you can do anything you want and be successful.

I started in a little chapel and got to look around an area before I met the first ‘boss’, a giant spider with lots of swords that killed me very quickly which apparently is a dark souls thing.I woke up in a grave where there was a small tutorial and killable boss and then went up on a lift... and wow, huge big world.  I got told to head north to a castle but I’m free to go anywhere. Walking the path to the north is a man on a horse.  And here is the thing.  Seems like I could kill it with my starter gear.  But he is very tough.  I would have to fight and die and learn and repeat, for a while.   Or.... I can sneak around and completely ignore him seemingly forever.   Or... I can go somewhere else, get some better stats and gear and come back and challenge him when I’m stronger.  Which is what I choose.So I decide to look around first.  Down south there is a beach.. to the east a forest... ruins to the west.. I found a little cave with a wolf man boss and while he killed me too, he was easier than the horse and after a few tries he was dead and I looted a talisman that helps me against fire, was quite rewarding I thought, nice buzz from killing the boss.Now I found a camp with enemy soldiers and take their armor.  I also got my weapon, the ‘flail’ which is ball on chain, and after getting the stats to use it I’m feeling stronger.  I also got to summon a pack of wolves.  I tried the horse guy again but he’s still a bit much so I am going to look somewhere else.So, to me this is super fun.  I’m very immersed, very challenged, I’m searching caves and fighting bosses and getting loot.  I’ve seen a HUGE dragon and the horse guy is waiting for me, as is apparently the first real boss who I haven’t even seen yet in 15 or so hours.  Now a lot of the reviews are about the performance.  World, music, graphics and gameplay is great but there are performance issues for sure.  Sometimes the grass just appears under me, and sometimes the frames stutter a bit.  I found that this doesn’t affect my game that much.  It’s not often enough that it matters to me personally, but I do understand that should exclude it from 10/10.  It is noticeable, and also the ‘quality’ mode is unplayable compared to performance mode, so it does need to take a point off just in terms of overall quality of the game.  I also did struggle with the character creation like I mentioned, the females are too masculine by default and perhaps this is a design choice, but I like to create characters that look a bit like me and they’re not allowing that here.  Not sure if this is a political statement or why, but really feels weird you can’t just say it’s a female body and have it look like a girl.  But when this is the main issue then have to say the game is good!  I happily give it 9/10 honestly.  I’m enjoying it a lot and when I’m not playing I’m thinking about what I’m going to do next.",0,0

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring is a Souls game at its core, but it's the ultimate version of a Souls game. It feels like the culmination of everything From Software has worked on in the last 15 years coming together in one incredible package. A massive, beautiful open world with dungeons all throughout. Top tier boss fights, and combat that's been refined, adopting some elements from previous FS games and introducing new mechanics like the guard counter. interesting and complex level design that will have you obsessively searching around every corner, and now with a whole new element of verticality thanks to jumping being introduced. RPG character building and stat allocation, allowing you to customize in depth what kind of character you want to play. If you're a fan of From Software's previous works it's 100% a must play.

The issue with the user reviews of this game is that it's the first From Soft game to truly catch the attention of the masses. These games do not hold your hand and they're not afraid to kick you into the dirt. I have a feeling this left a lot of people frustrated on first impression, who then promptly dropped the game and proceeded to write a negative review blaming their lack of ability on the game. If you're new to this series, keep in mind that it takes patience and persistence. It will be difficult at times, but you'll learn and overcome, eventually mastering the game, and I think once you do, these games offer an experience like no other.",0,0
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Best game of the decade! I love the souls series and this game is the best one that FromSoftware has ever made. They have taken everything of their previous developed games, picked the best parts and put it in a gigantic open world free to explore for everyone from beginning. And there is a lot to explore. There are so many different types of weapons with different playstyles. Every bossfight is unique and challenging. I will definetly buy a dlc of this game if they will develop one.",0,0
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"This game is amazing!  I will admit that I am biased, but FromSoft did it again.  I thought I wouldn't like the open world exploration bit because of how many games get that wrong, but I was very wrong.",0,0
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"After 40+ hours with the game, I can definitely say that it's one of the best open world games I've ever had the chance to play. Unlike most open world games that release nowadays, Elden Ring does not hold your hand constantly throughout your adventure, but instead gives you the core tools in order to go out and explore the huge world at your own pace.

It really does feel like everywhere you go, you will encounter some interesting creatures, npcs, locations and bosses. I believe that this is the most beginner friendly game from FromSoftware, as everytime you hit a wall you can just go someplace else and get stronger.

Regarding the difficulty, it's what you'd expect from a FromSoftware game. It packs a challenge, but it does provide all sorts of tools that you can use to ease your experience. Regarding the combat, you can tell that they have picked mechanics from all of their previous games, and it feels more fluid and developed than ever.

The art direction is amazing, from the moment you step outside into the world you are hit with a wonderful scenery and this stays consistent throughout the game.

I did not have any performance issues, the game stayed at a constant 55-60 fps on Performance Mode (PS5) and I've only experienced one minor bug.

I would take low ratings seen here with a grain of salt, it appears that they mostly come from people who were not familiar with FromSoftware's game style but bought the game without any research due to hype. If you like a game constantly telling you what to do, providing no challenge whatsoever, duplicating the same locations and enemies throughout the whole map while using basic and clunky fighting mechanics (basically most open world games nowadays), Elden Ring is not the game for you.

Otherwise, if you're looking for an adventure where you will feel extremely immersed and where you can feel like you are slowly getting better as you explore the world, please play it as soon as possible.",0,0
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I was shocked to see people giving this game a bad rating.  I am so picky when it comes to console games (games in general); however, this game appears flawless to me.  I loved the look of darksouls games but they were so damn hard.

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Things you need to know if you are a beginner:

The game is not easy, but it is not difficult either.
it's probably one of the most accessible From Software games ever. Take your time to learn the game mechanics and you won't regret it. Remember it is an RPG and tactics matter.

For those who have already played DS, it could be a ""more of the same"", but it is much improved in the mechanics and in the possibilities of the game.

The open world isn't perfect, but it makes you want to constantly explore it.

It has some technical flaws, but it will certainly be improved with patches in the coming weeks.",0,0

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"WARNING! Don't trust any reviews that gave the game a score under 5! A score like that is insulting to the developers who spent a lot of time creating this game. I am a huge Souls fan so my score is a bit bias. Some people mention the outdated graphics and yes the graphics aren't as good looking as the new horizon game, and there might be some pop-ins here and there, and yet this is still one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, because of the incredible art style. Other reviews mention the difficulty as being a bad part of the game, the game is mechanically difficult, this means that the enemies have complicated and fast move sets and you will die a lot, so of you don't enjoy that, I don't recommend the game. I've seen a lot of people mention that the game is empty, that is also false, the game is full of content and secrets, I have to admit that the sidequests and lore are very cryptic, this is also something that people criticized as being something bad but that is also incorrect. The game doesn't shove the story in your face rather it just roughly explains what's going on in the world whilst hiding a lot of the details under the hood. The main problem with those reviews is that they're comparing EldenRing to other open world games that are great and then say that ER is bad because it does things differently. I'll give an analogy to the absent story argument, let's say there's a sushi chef and he makes the best sushi in the world, like it's perfectly done, the rice is perfectly cooked, the fish is fresh from the market and there's a perfect amount of sauce. That would make it an objectively good sushi right? Would it then make sense to criticize the sushi for not having fries as a side dish when that was never the point of the meal? Of course not and in ER's case the fries is the story, Miyazaki never meant for EldenRing to have a storyline as the main part of the game. So if you're expecting a deep story like the Witcher3 I also don't recommend the game. However if you want to immerse yourself in an incredibly diverse and challenging world, where you can play with tons of different playstyles and if you enjoy exploration, the game is absolutely for you, of course there's much more to the game than the previously mentioned points, but those are things you'll find out for yourself !",0,0
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Id rate this game a 9 but want to counter some of the review bombing. It seems like many people fell into the game because of the hype unprepared for how fromsoft does its storytelling. If you talk to npcs and read item descriptions the rich story comes together very well. The world is chockfull of great gear and unique encounters. And folks who think comparing the mechanics to previous fromsoft titles is a reason for a low score confuse me. There is plenty added to the combat system and a new degree of verticality that makes exploring better than its ever been. Im about 50hrs in and still getting surprised by things, and still feel engaged. Didnt have to grind once. If something in the map feels hard, come back to it later, not a tricky concept in open world games. I will say that the performance issues at launch are problematic, but nothing that wont get addressed in patches. The game is hard, but the open world helps with accessibility since you can try somewhere else. I will critique that the game should imply more thoroughly that following the main bath for a bit first nets you the ability to level, travel faster, and use items that help your progression. Missing those and wandering off is a possibility. Im probably a fromsoft fanboy, and this game requires time and immersive investment. But I think its great, and doesnt deserve to get review bombed by people who didnt bother to listen to the npcs talk about the world.",0,0

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Please refrain from coming to do review bombing, this is not just a game, it is a piece of art that reflects the dedication and love of the developers, it is a large-scale dark fantasy world that will make you stick to the screen for hours if you have enough dedication.

This is not a game that takes you by the hand and tells you who you should talk to, where you have to go, what objects you should get, basically nothing, because you are the one who must be observant, pay attention to the environment, discover things for yourself, in other words, think.

The graphics are the same as what was shown in the demos and previews, if the graphics were not to your liking, why did they buy the game and then come to say that they are bad?
The game features some framerate issues on ps5 and other platforms, but that will be fixed over time.
The graphics are very good, enough to set us in its story.
The gameplay is basically the same as the previous souls, which is more than fine, with more flexible mechanics and we can even jump!
The designs of the enemies are excellent, some even scary.
The design of the world is the best I've seen in any video game, much better than the Witcher or Zelda, just incomparable and it's going to take your breath away.
In conclusion, this game is not for everyone, most of us got more than we expected from the game and beforehand it had already been communicated that the difficulty was going to be similar to its previous games, if you do not like the graphics because it is your opinion but not the absolute truth, because most of us love them.",0,0
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Very sad that some users are giving this beautiful piece of gaming history bad scores because of occasional pop in or stutters. I honestly think that most of them didn't even play the game they just wanted an easy mode but ultimately didn't get one, either that or they just want their favorite game to be rated higher. Either way, I am 43 hours into the game and I can say without a doubt that I have never had as many ""ooo"" and ""ahhhhh"" moments while playing a video game. Elden Ring is an RPG lovers Dream, a very dark dream but a wonderful one nonetheless. Combat is a step above DS3 adding different mechanics and weapons. Ashes of war allow for weapon customization ive never experienced in soulsborne game and the spells offer some of the most stunning visuals to date. The big selling point for me is the amount of exploration that can be done while traversing the lands between. Continuously setting a marker on my map to go see what awaits me at my destination only to notice something lurking in the distance or a cave that I would have missed had I not been trying to avoid the enemies in the middle of the area. My only issue with this game is the way quests are tracked, please note I am very familiar with the works of Fromsoft and their approach to quests and the usual exhaustion of dialogue to progress a characters storyline so you can speak with them again in the next area. I just feel it could have been optimized better for a game of this scale.

Performance was absolutely ok for me on my PS5. No issues in boss fights just sometimes a slight lag while exploring (just a second or so).
Music is great, its extremely tough even for Souls Veterans. I played every single souls game and I must say that the Elden Ring main Bosses are maybe the hardest of the whole Franchise.

"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Tough break for Horizon Forbidden West, coming out a week before Elden Ring. Both are fantastic games, but from the moment my copy of Elden Ring arrived, I haven't touched the former. Elden Ring isn't perfect, but it is easily my favorite souls-like game, with Bloodborne coming in second. I'll quickly address the review bombers: most of these 0 scores are clearly bad faith and shouldn't be entertained. On the PS5, I haven't had any performance issues in my 80 hours of gameplay, although I have seen some minor bugs like pop-in which I'm sure will be addressed with future patches. And that's that. For the positives, there are so many. Here are a few of mine that I haven't seen mentioned:

1) HORSE COMBAT. This is by far the coolest addition to the game. It's not mechanically complex, but man it's entertaining to mow down an enemy camp like a 12th century marauder on horseback. And boss battles on horseback, of which there are MANY, take on an epic and high-stakes nature I hadn't previously experienced in a souls-like game.

2) Seamless blend of linear and non-linear gameplay. Some open world games, like GTA 5 and RDR2, do this very poorly. Linear indoor sections feel like an afterthought and the on-the-rails nature of the action kills any sense of tension. In Elden Ring, linear indoor areas and non-linear outdoors areas work seamlessly together to vary up the gameplay. For instance, you're free to wander the open map and engage or not engage enemies as you see fit. But then you venture into a massive castle, or an underground city, and the game takes on the tension, suspense, and danger of previous souls-likes, with traps, ambushes, and puzzles. It's great.

3) An open world game that doesn't hold your hand. Take Horizon for example. Anytime you arrive at a new location, NPCs and points of interest are automatically marked for you on the map with a ?. Quests are listed in the quest log. This is all very convenient, but for me it takes away from the immersion. Quests become a tedious laundry list to complete. Not in Elden Ring though. No quest markers. No quest logs. The only hints you receive are organically in-game and it's up to you to remember them. Just like in REAL LIFE, right?? It's a great concept and encourages you to scour every inch of the detailed world for hidden dungeon entrances, NPCs, merchants, and bosses.

As I said above, Elden Ring isn't a perfect game, but it's probably my favorite open world game, BOTW included. I hope this short review has piqued your interest! Don't let the bad faith actors dissuade you.",0,0
"Mar  3, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"On PC I've had few of the problems, from my own looking into the problems it seems the problems are only with the highest end computers not the mid range computers like mine. On the game play it feels like a more refined and expanded Dark Souls 3, so for those familiar with From Soft think better DS3 with a massive open world.
For anyone not familiar with the games, this is a game that takes time and skills that you'll learn by playing, from boss moves and when to attack, roll/jump to not get hit. When playing there's always a way to avoid damage but learning how to get around it will take time. That's to say the ""Get good"" meme is actually the advice due to every playstyle being just as viable as each other, but ultimately Elden Ring just like the other Soulsborn games they aren't easy games that everyone will be able to just pick up, but if you have the time and patience you can get good enough to go the whole game never taking damage at level 1.",0,0

Elden ring is a truly open ended and beautiful world with more stunning variety and play-style choice than any other Soulslike the universal difficulty system works perfectly i have found myself bashing my head against the wall of a difficult boss only to go around it and find dungeons and side bosses and items and then i return to that boss and kick its ass. the world is designed to teach you, if you are capable of listening and learning this game will hone your skill into combat supremacy without you even realizing until after you triumph.

The world itself is also lore and story rich with exploration being reward with pieces of story, visage and character development. this game will be as good as you want it to be if you enter expecting freedom and fun you will receive that if you enter expecting combat and triumph against adversity that you will find as you improve.

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I'm a big fan of FromSoft games so my opinion is little biased but i think everybody can agree that when a game that has as much hype as this one and it doesn't end up as a disaster like a certain(ehem...Cyberpunk) everybody is happy. Yes it has some flaws like any other game but it more than makes up for them by how good the rest is.

Negatives:
_bosses are repeated in dungeons quite often(but they are 100% optional so no big deal).
_A lot enemies can be found in all regions, but all open world games have this(botw has bokoblins everywhere.
_The pc port is pretty bad, this is just an L nothing i can say about that but i have the ps5 version and i only had a framedrop after 43 hours of playing.
_Horseback battles are not the best (they're still very awkward).
_Keeping up with character quests is a headache, a good headache but a headache none the less.

Positives:
_Insane boss veriety(i think there's like 80 unique bosses).
_The most beutiful(not the best looking graphically) i have ever seen.
_ Absolutely enormous build options, weapon types, sorceries, incatations, jump attacks, charged attacks, parries, powerstancing(dual weilding) and finally horseback battle.
_Amazing story telling/story line(if you are curious enough)
_An easy mode for more casual players in the form of spirit summons, coop, npc summons and OP weapons.
_spectacular main story bosses.
_Many plot twists.
_Unparalleled sense of scale.
_Great diversity in areas.
_Top tier music(as expected of Yuka Kitamura)
_Chalenging for those looking for a chalenge.
_Jumping (Praise the jumping).
_The amazing FromSoft level design.

It's not a game for a lot of people but for those who like these games or those who want to give it a shot, it's something special.",0,0

"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"For all those saying this is a ds3 clone, that is completely false. There has been vast improvements in balancing, with all strategies being viable and effective. An example of this is guard counters. In past games, even when using great shields, you would have to dodge roll to create openings to attack, as there was no way to counter large enemies after blocking an attack. This made blocking Almost useless against larger bosses and enemies, as dodging was almost always more effective. This has been completely solved in elden ring. Performing a heavy attack after blocking an enemy strike activates a guard counter. This attack deals massive damage, as well as having a chance to break your opponents guard for a critical hit. This gives defensive players who prefer to block attacks rather than dodge a very effective way to deal damage. There are many other ways that this game expands on the souls formula (such as bow jump attacks, mounted combat, and more) but this is the best example. Elden ring has the best open world I have ever experienced. It's vibrant and full of life, with many hidden secrets and npcs to discover. The dungeons are great ways to reward exploration. With unique rewards varying from helpful spirit summons to special weapons, I always feel incenavized to explore every nook and cranny of the beautiful open world. While the graphics aren't groundbreaking, the art direction certainly is. The environments are stunning, and the enemy design is grotesque and amazing. I found myself enjoying how the world looks in elden ring much more than horizon (of which many people are comparing elden ring to) simply because of the art design and uniqeness of the landscape. This game is everything I wanted it to be and more, with improved souls combat, a vast and secret packed open world as well as amazing enemies and bosses.",0,0
"Mar  4, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"I'm 60 hours in, on the final boss, and I can honestly say this is the best game I've ever played. I'm not sure what everyone else is talking about in these low review scores. It's like we are playing a completely different game. I'm playing the PS5 version on PS5 and have had no problems with dipping frames or any graphical errors at all. The visuals are absolutely stunning. I've found myself just stopped and staring at the gorgeous surroundings more than a handful of times. The bosses are difficult, but it never feels unfair. The story is the easiest-to-follow story of any FromSoft game. There are many NPC sidequests to do that make the world feel fleshed out and lived in. There are completely optional areas that make you engage with the world and figure out a way to get there and when you finally figure it out, you feel super accomplished and the game often awards your curiosity with a boss or a rare item. I haven't had this much fun with a game in a long time. Don't listen to all these low reviews of people who haven't even gotten past the first area yet. Elden Ring is a must-buy for everyone.",0,0

"Mar  5, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Do you remember your first?

Mine was Dark Souls, following its' predecessor Demon souls (Widely considered a harder game). I've thought each Souls game released since has become easier in small steps and, whether this was due to my consistent meat grinder educational sessions or the actual lowering of the difficulty of their games... I'm unsure, it left me with a desire for something that gave me that same desperate, clawing feeling that the first had given me.

This game is absolutely it.

It seems that some might also find it ""too easy"" and others ""too challenging"", a CONSTANT discussion to be had among fans and those who hate it alike, but I think one of the most common feelings among the fanbase is the sense of ACCOMPLISHMENT. Which comes at the end of your blade, staff, depravity, cooperation... and how ever long it take you it feels great and, I feel, exponentially more so when you are punished to perfection. I have spent the lion's share of my free time over this last week delving into Elden ring, and have not felt once like I had ENOUGH time. Always wanting for more.

This game has already sparked many, among many conversations and each of them are worth their own salt, or gold, or bin stuffing, or what ever! But one of the most common topics I see elsewise, the last I'll address in this particular review, is simply: The wrong way to play.

Which I VERY strongly suggest would be to not play it at all.

I hope to see you out there, Tarnished.

-T

EDIT: I would like to add, not wanting to risk looking like a total fan boy, that there are certainly some issues. I've been playing on PS4 and have genuinely seen no performance problems. I haven't tried it on any other platform so my review reflects my experience.

If I had to pick something apart it would be that there seems to be some balancing needed in how runes are distributed. Sixty seconds on your preferred search engine will yield you several results as to how to grind at ludicrous rates, some not requiring any fighting even. I think this might be more a nitpick than anything since how other people enjoy a game means very little to how I enjoy it.

Now PVP.... PVP is a whole different animal... and once I figure out how to counter the maidenless sub-tarnished that shows up into my world in only tattered sack pants, surrounds themselves in an impenetrable barrier, and spams lightening bolts I can't dodge until my squealing death... I will make them pay.",0,0

"Mar  6, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"I am well aware of other people's gripes with the game, I am not massive souls fan but I have played each of them and quite enjoyed them. I agree with others reviews that the games reuses models, even from Dark Souls 3, that there are pop ins when you load into an area. However the main complaints seems to be that people don't know how to play a game that doesn't hold your hand.
People who expect to be guided like a baby and told what to you, this is not the game for you. Everything is about exploration and beating a challenge, or learning when to move on and return later.

It is true that there are NPC quests but the game doesn't mark it on the map. The NPCs will tell you or hint at what you have to do and its is up to you to figure it our or stumble on the location like I have most of the time.

I don't really care about graphics, but the game is very beautiful. Is it Horizon levels of gorgeous, of course not, this is a game where gameplay seems to be the main focus and graphics second. Which is fine by me, as no matter how gorgeous a game may look if it sucks ass I will get bored quick.

As far as gameplay is concerned, its very FromSoft. You can be a giant hammer wielding sorcerer, or a shield only lightning faith build, or a dual wielding katana, one dealing bleeding damage and another poison, a fire wielding double lance user who throws holy dame when two handing. There are many ways to play the game and yes unlike other soul games, you can respec.

Don't let salty reviewers who don't know how to read or have no patience tell you what to do or think, but do keep this in mind. If you have no patience and don't like dying over and over, need to told what to do to enjoy a game then this is definitely not for you.

Regarding story, it is fine. Its not as hidden or confusing as in Dark Souls or Bloodborne. I understood the overall plot, the smaller details I will learn through VaatiVidya, as will most likely all of use giving a high score, like I said above FromSoftware games aren't loved by their story but its gameplay.

If there is one issue I do have with the game, is the NPC quest component. Unlike previous games this world is huge, having at least a journal in game with the last conversation has with each NPC would be good enough for me. On the other hand, I'm going old school keeping a journal myself with areas and NPC met, its pretty fun and I've never been much of a notetaker.",0,0

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"If you can't handle difficulty and/or need hand holding with quest logs and location markers, this game isn't for you. That doesn't make it a bad game, in fact quite the contrary. It is a breath of fresh air in a world full of easy games that treat the players like children. (Looking at you, Horizon)

From Software respects their customers, delivering a complete AAA experience, with no microtransactions, pay to win, skin purchases, or anything of the sort. The price you pay for the game unlocks everything there is, and every player gets the same experience.

Having completed the game after investing over 100 hours, I can say that it's easily the deepest, richest, most rewarding open world RPG I've ever played. I rarely replay games, but despite investing over 100 hours, I missed a tonne of content, and multiple
endings, so I will be replaying this game.

The scenery is beautiful, the bosses are the best FS have ever created, the story deep and fascinating (although not spoon fed, you need to look for it).

Are there games out there with better graphics? Yes. Does that ditract from the experience? Not at all. Technically the graphics could be better. They could have implemented ray tracing, better shadows, reflections, etc, etc, but that isn't what matters. The art style and visuals are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen in any game.",0,0
"Mar  7, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"Honestly, fighting some bosses hitless in this game is just horrible. Margit has overly fast swings in phase 2, and Renalla spams way too much magic. This is work-around-able by having some x-factor such as a ranged attack or summons, but being fair to fist/broken sword only is what made dss, ds1 and ds3 (or even ds2) fun. In Sekiro it only gave you one option, so all bossfights were based around this type of playstyle too. Otherwise, I REALLY like it, but having some bossfights feel to passive or even **** really hurts the enjoyability of Elden Ring as a whole.P.s. I hate that one Godrick attack in phase 2. You know the one.",0,0

"Mar  8, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Easily the best game I've played in years, and almost certainly the best game that From Software has ever made. Elden Ring is a game that respects the player's intelligence and curiosity.

Unlike so many recent open-world games, it won't lead you by the hand and tell you where to go at every turn. You have the freedom to travel to every castle or mountain you see in the distance, and it's up to you to figure out how to get there, and get past any obstacles in your way. There's no easy mode, but there are plenty of tools to make the game easier if you're willing to explore and experiment, and of course you can always practice until you git gud. Parts of it may be frustrating to new players, but the reward is some truly amazing vistas and some of the most amazing boss fights in any game, ever.

The world is rich and detailed, and there's tons of lore, but the story is mostly kept in the background to keep the focus on combat and exploration. There aren't hours of drawn-out cutscenes with characters endlessly yapping on. There are characters who you'll meet on your journeys, but almost all of the time you're adventuring on your own, charting your own path forward, with little to guide you except the towering landmarks in the horizon.

The combat will feel familiar to Souls veterans, but there are some small additions to the combat to make things a bit more dynamic, like a block counter move that's like an alternate way to parry. Spirit ashes let you summon a wide variety of creatures into boss fights, which can range from mild distractions to truly overpowered beasts. The mounted combat is surprisingly good, and you're even given the option to fight many boss fights either mounted or on foot, and I found myself preferring to fight mounted against many bosses. The main fights are all truly epic, and normal enemy encounters manage to be just as dynamic and challenging.

There are downsides to the Souls games going open-world. While the main ""legacy"" dungeons are all amazing, there are smaller optional dungeons tucked away in the form of catacombs, forts, mines and caves. While some of them have interesting level design and bosses, some of them feel phoned-in, a bit like Bloodborne's automatically-generated Chalice Dungeons. There are also repeated overworld mini-boss fights, like the Dragons, Erdwood Tree Avatars, and Night Riders. While they were all engaging boss fights, especially on horseback, fighting 6-7 variations on each with only minor differences does get a bit repetitive, but they're all purely optional.

Elden Ring can be an absolutely gorgeous game to look at. The game isn't cutting-edge visually, and in certain places you're reminded that it's still running on some of the same engine FromSoft has used for over a decade, but the beautiful vistas make up for all of it. At it's best the game looks like a concept art painting come to life, and even if every last tooth doesn't have a million polygons, the artistry that goes into the world and character design is as good as anything out there. I recommend playing with HDR if you can (which goes for pretty much all games that support it, but still.)

While the game's freedom of exploration is mostly a positive, sometimes it does get a bit too vague for it's own good. The lack of a quest log is usually fine, but can sometimes be a bit frustrating, and you can miss whole questlines if you miss a vague hint or don't stumble on the right shack. It's not a game where you're really intended to experience everything in a single playthrough, but it can still be a bit annoying to miss a whole questline by mistake. As I got further into the game I did find myself looking things up more and more often, which took me out of the game somewhat, although I still prefer it to the game hand-feeding me everything.

Even with those flaws, Elden Ring is an incredible experience. At it's best, it really feels like you're a lone explorer a hostile, mysterious world. At it's worst, you're potentially dealing with hours of frustration and yank. But for me, the lows only serve to enhance the highs, and the end result is one of the most engrossing games ever.",0,0

Its an amazing looking game and at some moments i just catch myself in awe because of how good it looks. The gameplay is smooth and honestly i hardly ran into technical problems which i think is more of people getting mad at being bad tbh and blaming it on whatever they can. this is my first meta review i love dark souls and this game is for sure money well spent",0,0
"Mar 13, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring is one of the best games I have ever played, and one of the only open-world games I can actually handle. The game utilizes its open-world setting brilliantly, encouraging exploration which is always enjoyable in this game, as well as rewarding, granting you experience and materials with ease if you explore hard enough, instead of farming a certain enemy.

This is where a lot of people start to fault when it comes to reviews: they think it's some regular RPG, like Pokemon - that is NOT the case. Enemies are not as repetitive as described, and if you think a challenge is too hard and requires you to farm enemies, then you are simply playing the game wrong. This game does not revolve around levels, and whilst it may make it slightly easier, the game revolves around skill, it is why battles don't involve RNG and can be beaten without leveling up at all, just like any other Dark Souls game.

The only real complaint is that when a game has so many bosses, sometimes they blend together and seem generic, which is not surprising - it's an open-world game, but there are some very distinct bosses that shine through and are phenomenal.

People who are placing these reviews either have not played the game, or have played it for very little but in the wrong manner, and therefore have not been fully able to gain full enjoyment. And of course, if you need to play a game in a certain way to enjoy it, that may be a negative, but the game is so explicit with how you have to play, that it just seems people are treating the game like it's any other and therefore made to seem worse.

Elden Ring is extremely unique and is not like any other. Git Gud.",0,0

"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,10,"Elden Ring is an RPG that builds on the from soft formula that they have been building for years. Although this instalment does not drastically change the gameplay, the additions to the mechanics and improvement of aesthetics are more than welcome. Elden Ring at it's best is an incredible action RPG that does not forget what roleplaying means. You can start the game as whoever you want, and that doesn't restrict who you can become in any way. Quest-lines give you choice in a way not seen in the dark souls series prior. The open world is non-restrictive and the land is intricately connected to the lore and the history that has been built to give you an idea of the care and detail that has been built for this game. The lore and the world have been so intertwined that learning something about the lore will 9 times out of 10 add to your ability to play the game. The difficulty and freedom, however, are not for everybody. This means that many of the characteristics that are purposefully part of the game may be seen as bad, or aversive to many who don't click with the gameplay, freedom, or storytelling. Although everyone's likes and dislikes are valid, this does mean that this game is not for all audiences. This is perfectly ok though, as it does not take away from what has been accomplished in the release of this game.",0,0
"Mar 19, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,9,"A fantastic game overall and a very unique take on the open-world action-RPG genre. That said, I do not believe this game was well optimized for next-gen consoles, especially the PS5 in particular. This was the only game I voluntarily played in quality mode (30fps) for a majority of the experience due to the semi-frequent frame drops, and I'm spoiled rotten by high framerates. Also, I would've loved to see the DualSense's features involved a little more in the experience, a la Demon's Souls, such as the adaptive triggers and more haptics. Although I can't ignore how well the SSD works in loading a massive game like this lightning-fast, which especially makes (frequently) dying feel far less of a chore, albeit with some major pop-in every now and then. Nonetheless, the gameplay and design of the game itself are nothing short of amazing and very smartly designed, although I can name a few bosses which relied a bit too heavily on RNG and luck to properly manage (e.g. a certain endgame boss's snow attack, and a gank boss in a mid-late game underground area of Limgrave). I also LOVE how forgiving the checkpoints are before most bosses and major encounters, which IMO, is a massive improvement from past Souls games, especially DeS. Nonetheless, like a majority of people, I strongly recommend this game for Soulsborne newcomers or those who found the past FromSoft games too challenging, but still, know what you're getting into and as everyone says: git gud.",0,0

"Mar 22, 2022",Elden Ring,playstation-5,0,"This is my first ever souls game I have ever had the will to play. I played DS, DS2, and DS3 for like an hour and stopped because I just felt like those games weren't made for me. Years later this gem drops and I have to be honest, I haven't been hooked on a game like this since Monster Hunter: World. This game is phenomenal, scary, beautiful, stressing, breathtaking, but most importantly.... FUN, which is something not a lot of games have nowadays. The world is expansive and so incredibly detailed. The weapons and armor look sick and the combat is really good, it kinda makes you want to master it since that is what the game is all about, fighting giant bosses. The target lock on camera can get a bit annoying if there are multiple enemies in an area but that's mostly a me type of thing. I have been playing for 55 hours so far and it feels like I haven't even scratched the surface of this game and I really don't want it to end. I really enjoy this game and I feel like this is perfect for newcomers like myself to jump in and lose yourself in the vast world of Elden Ring. It may look a little intimidating at first, but that is part of the challenge. That's what makes this game FUN, the challenge. That momentous feeling after killing Margit or Godrick or even the tree sentinel really gives you an indescribable sense of accomplishment, redemption and pride. Then you keep going, you're getting better, stronger, wiser, and more skilled and to me that alone really makes this game so FUN to me. This game has set a standard and I really do believe that this is my GOTY. I love you God of War: Ragnarok, but this game has really blown my mind.
