0,elden-ring,08-Mar-22,5,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Where do I begin on this title and the insanely inflated hype around it? Elden Ring is yet another entry to the Souls genre, and this time steps away from the tried and true design of tightly crafted game worlds that Fromsoft usually brings us. Unfortunately, we are left with a bland and lifeless Overworld, connected with obscured dungeons that feel copied straight from Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons. There was something missed in translation here, as most open worlds draw you in with a plethora of things to experience, not just empty space between the next thing to kill.
<br/>Speaking of killing, the entire game revolves around removing enemies out of your way. This is the same as every Souls game, but this is supposed to be an open world experience. Imagine just laying a linear game out on top of a big map and calling it ""open world"" now. With nothing else to do, you will be traveling across large, empty expanses to find another repetitive dungeon, another rehashed enemy, another reskinned boss...with rewards that do not give you incentive to explore. You hit walls where you cannot pass, so you must go try a different route until you are strong enough to do the ""intended"" route. You will begin to lose steam after the honeymoon phase wears off.
<br/>
<br/>The bosses get progressively more ridiculous as you move through the game. Instead of opting for a dance of combat like Bloodborne or Sekiro, you will spend the entire battle rolling around, counting on iframes to help scrape you out of a 9-hit combo alive, where each hit of the combo can chunk you for most of your health. Enemies everywhere rely on delay attacks, holding their weapons in the air just until you finish rolling for a cheap kill. Some will defy physics and spin midair to land on you. The whole thing is about being cheesed by enemies or cheesing them by leveling. Even having the strongest physical defense armor in the entire game, plus dumping most of your points into Vigor, you will still be 2 shot by end bosses. Highly disappointing.
<br/>
<br/>The ""open world"" is rife with shambling creatures that walk in circles or wait patiently for you to approach and dispatch them.  NPC stand around, lifeless in this uninspired world. You cannot track any quests, so unless you have a really good memory, you are expected to play with a journal by your side for notes. The UI used is ugly and over a decade old. Movement is nearly a direct copy from Dark Souls 3, with weapon Arts.
<br/>
<br/>The biggest crime here, though, is the reviews from Critics. Unanimously overflowing 10/10 review from nearly every gaming company out there. For a continuation of pretty niche type of game, the how is unreal. Especially when NOTHING here is revolutionary, inventive, or deserving of the word ""masterpiece."" At best it is bait to get people to buy Elden Ring, only to be highly disappointed after the refund return window has closed.
<br/>
<br/>Lastly, the hype of George RR Martin to sell the game! This is just using a name to sell your product. You can replace entire words with phrases from Dark Souls. Point of Lost Grace = Bonfire.
<br/>
<br/>Watch reviews (not 10/10 ""critic"" reviews, but actual USER reviews), check out some gameplay. Read reddit posts that are not biased towards it being great. Don't just jump on a train taking gaming in the wrong direction.</span>",34,52
1,elden-ring,03-Mar-22,7,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">While Elden Ring is a good game, it certainly does not warrant the perfect scores it has received.<br/><br/>You’re basically playing Breath of the Wild meets Dark Souls 3, but Elden Ring isn’t as good as either game. The scores for this game are blown way out of proportion. Like I said, it’s a good game but it isn’t great. Exploring is both fun and tedious. I was disappointed with the lack of content in the open world and even more disappointed in the boss fights. Combat is what you would expect from a Souls game but the one-shot deaths and overly-difficult bosses left a really bad taste in my mouth. I think, at this point, FromSoftware has run out of ideas to make their games challenging and rewarding and instead have made Elden Ring tedious and frustrating. What’s good in the game is good. What’s bad and lazy in the game is just plain bad and lazy. With horrible dual boss fights, a lack of content in the world, frustrating enemies, extremely slow character animations (even by Souls standards), confusing map design and cheap deaths, I expected so much more from this game. Overall, you’re left with a decent game that gets boring and tedious very quickly. Magic is definitely the way to go in this game. Approach it similarly to Demon’s Souls. I’m glad Elden Ring exists, but I think the Souls forumla is best left to actual Souls games.</span>",19,31
2,elden-ring,26-Feb-22,10,<span>This is the ultimate version of Dark Souls thanks to its vast and gigantic open world.</span>,241,400
3,elden-ring,12-Mar-22,6,"<span>If it's the GOTY, this year would be awful for gaming. It's just a Dark Souls 4 in an open world, nothing more. I you don't like the Dark Souls series and other look alike, you won't like this game too. The open world isn't revolutionary as some people said.</span>",31,52
4,elden-ring,28-Feb-22,4,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">it was supposed to be one of the best games ever but it didn't. From a technical point of view it has big problems both from the graphic point of view (it looks like a game of two generations ago) and from the performance point of view (the continuous drop in frames is unnerving). Incredible AI is also lost with NPCs and some bosses. The gameplay remains solid and clean. The last downside and perhaps the worst is the total recycling of assets as if it were a copy and paste. Had it been the sequel to dark souls 3 I would have also understood but not being the sequel, I find the recycling of assets in bad taste. Failed.</span>",81,145
5,elden-ring,28-Feb-22,5,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Calling this game a must play is just wrong. The overall critic rating is a result of about 50 hardcore souls-fans that are willing to ignore many, many issues and only focus on the thrill of endless boss fights (admittedly - definitely thrilling). But this game is so far from perfect.
<br/>
<br/>In terms of visuals and performance - it is very far from next gen. The animations, the frame rate, the pop-in. The world almost never responds to the player. I like the art style but next to games like Guardians or the Galaxy or Horizon ll it looks like a sharper PS4 game at best.
<br/>
<br/>Some weapons are good but the overall combat system is unbalanced. Story is told in very lazy way but no one cares about that.
<br/>
<br/>Enemy design (especially bosses of course) is often brilliant and the music is fantastic. The open world is fun to explore but to stay it's revolutionary is far from the truth imo.
<br/>
<br/>The only things that makes this game so exciting is chemistry in your brain. The thrill of defeating a giant boss is amazing, and the hard, fixed difficulty is what makes every encounter so intense. Same for exploration and the sense of constant danger.
<br/>
<br/>It's no wonder that From Software refused to add an easy mode. Without the sense of accomplishment after beating a boss, without the constant fear and sense of danger, this game has almost nothing to offer, and it's definitely not a next-gen, must play title.</span>",80,151
6,elden-ring,06-Mar-22,5,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Definetly the worst game from the soul series, as it even gets to be called a ""soul series game"" even though it pretends (or was marketed pretending to) be something new and different. It is not. The game is a poor mixture of Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne and Sekiro. It's absolutely generic, as it copies infinite secondary and mini-bosses from the previous games. The game is an eternal liop in a poor open word, boring and repetitive, with no plot (contrary to what was sold, using the name of George R. R. Martin). After all that, graphics were far better on Demon Souls. Even still, the game struggles to load scenarios, hardly runs smooth on 60 fps using the performance mode and has a lot of issues. For example, I had one boss, wich was so generic I can't remind his name, being sanding still at his final 10% of life waiting for me to put him out of misery (wich was probably being a part of this game). Never seen such an overrated game. I only recomend it if you are in for some dark souls copied gameplay, wich may be fun. Don't expect more than that.</span>",21,40
7,elden-ring,02-Mar-22,5,"<span>It's far from a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Outdated graphics, poor optimization, simply not that great. I'd like to see reviews from journalists that aren't huge FS fans. This is a disgrace.</span>",62,119

<br/>Man I don't know what is warranting these high scores, I've never seen so many misleading review scores in my entire life. There's no story really, just esoteric lore peppered around. While the open world can be visually interesting from a aesthetic point of view at times, the open world can feel boring, empty lots of space and no real incentive to fight a lot of the monsters. So the BOTW comparisons is laughable and Skyrim! lol i cant even... The game isn't bad its just 100% more of the same, don't let these people fool you about the magic of ""discovering the open world""  That this is straight up dark souls 4. same look, same feel same outdated graphics and same gameplay. You fight monsters in sometimes interesting fantasy settings, with extremely difficult combat. But 10s!! no!</span>",83,163

11,elden-ring,02-Mar-22,6,<span>The frame rate is bad in the performance mode. Rock solid 60 fps is mandatory for such game where your reflex plays first role. I do not understand why you have released it knowing how it works…</span>,47,95
12,elden-ring,02-Mar-22,4,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">This is sadly a terribly over hyped game it seems like 90% of this games budget went to advertising it,upon playing it I see that the same exact game could have been made as a mod with Dark Souls asset packs on PC,the combat is the exact same the other games minus a jump attack,same janky camera bad hit detection and sometimes unresponsive controls,no doubt in my mind these gaming outlets were paid off big time for the laughably inflated 10 score this is kind of a shell of a game,and will probably be bargain   bin fodder in 2 to 3 months</span>",40,81
13,elden-ring,03-Mar-22,5,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Let's break into points:
<br/>1. A boring repetitive empty giant open world. Generic and recycled bosses and enemies;
<br/>2. The same old-style FromSoftware way of telling a story: a boring puzzle that has to be solved through reading hundreds of items descriptions and cryptic conversations with stoned NPCs;
<br/>3. Clunky combat system and light-speed bosses from Tekken: rolling through infinite AoE attack combos just to land one or two strikes, repeat;
<br/>4. Few pieces of equipment and terrible drop rates. You kill a boss just to receive some useless material;
<br/>5. Very beautiful art direction, BUT terrible graphics;
<br/>6. Poor performance;
<br/>7. Different from Dark Souls, and the others, Elden Ring is mediocre at building tension. Dark Souls is a game that has you always under pressure, theres is little to no rest. You can only feel safe when you're resting at a bonfire. When you play for the first time, you never know what to expect. Enemies are strategically placed, as well as traps. And they're everywhere, all the time. Elden Ring can't do this. There are long pauses to ""commune with nature"", because the big empty open world is not threatening. You can see the enemies from distance, and you're never caught by surprise. The way from Ruin A to Ruin B is safe and sound... And once you approach Ruin B, you know ""ok, now I'll face some challenge"", at this moment, there's no tension, it was ruined by the anticipation. You always know what to expect and when;
<br/>8. Multiplayer is the same old song: dependant on consumable items and limited to smoke walls. FS could have delivered a true multiplayer, but they are too addicted to the same old colorful phantoms paradigma.
<br/>Am I saying the game is not good? No, I'm not. I'm just convicted that Elden Ring is far from being the  Eight World Wonder that media wants it to be. Way too far from 97 on Metacritic. In my opinion, the worst among it's siblings.</span>",56,114

15,elden-ring,28-Feb-22,3,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">En gustos se rompen géneros y definitivamente este juego no es para todos. Me parece un juego terrible en el mal sentido, entiendo que al ser un juego Souls sea difícil pero con Elden Ring a los desarrolladores se les ha ido la mano y no se siente difícil sino más bien injusto. Me explico:
<br/>
<br/>En Elden Ring la dificultad se basa en lo lento, débil y torpe que es tu personaje, mientras que los enemigos son rápidos, fuertes y ¡DIOS MIO! Vaya que aguantan los golpes. Conforme avances podrás ir mejorando poco a poco tus habilidades, para esto necesitaras runas, así que prepárate para farmearlas como loco porque son indispensables, aquí es donde entra la parte ABURRIDA del juego. Algunos jefes son tan fuertes que si no subes tu nivel te será imposible vencerlos y ahí es donde me choca mucho Elden Ring. Tan solo para matar al primer jefe principal, tarde 2 horas y tuve que subir al nivel 23 para lo cual me tarde 7 horas de juego, de esas 7 horas la mitad puedo decir que fueron aburridas, ya que, aunque el mundo de Elden Ring es enorme, tienes que tener mucho cuidado de no morir y perder todas tus runas, entonces no te puedes divertir como quisieras debido a este factor. Al final Elden Ring se basa en: morir, mejora tus habilidades, vuelve a morir, sigue mejorando, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere, muere... Y no porque seas en si un mal jugador, sino porque simplemente el juego es injusto y te CASTIGA por cualquier pequeño error de forma despiadada.
<br/>
<br/>Si tu idea de un juego divertido es la de morir, morir, morir y morir, tardarte de mínimo 2 horas en derrotar a un jefe y pasar largas sesiones de juego farmeando para crecer de nivel, Elden Ring es para ti. Si prefieres un juego retador y que no se sienta TAN injusto te recomiendo mejor acercarte a juegos como Sekiro o Bloodborne. Elden Ring simplemente no vale la pena.</span>",41,86
16,elden-ring,02-Mar-22,3,"<span>Don't believe professional reviewers. I played the series from Demon's Souls on PS3, there is not much changed. Everything about this game is outdated, with usually terrible controls for 2022, fight mechanics, interface, boss fight patterns. The only cool thing is boss designs.
<br/>If this game would not have a badge of From Software it would never be given more than 5 out of 10 score.</span>",18,38
17,elden-ring,01-Mar-22,5,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Very pretty but after a while you feel the world is silent and alone, often feeling like a fantasy MMO with no other people playing.  It's not that the game is bad just the world while surprising at times is often very quiet.  It also seems to be a large map of ""lets see what's over there and can I kill it?""  I'm not sure what exactly is says about a game that the community is more concerned with finding leveling exploit spots than discussing the game it's self.  If you like a constant string of challenging combat this will be for you.  Everyone else?  It's okay to explorers their is a lot to see.  Anyone who likes a game to give you an explanation of how things work and where things are...you will not find that.</span>",52,110
18,elden-ring,26-Feb-22,10,<span>What an incredible game this is a wholesome openworld game I dont understand why some of the idiots are writing emotional review how could people without rational judgment write a review?</span>,56,119
19,elden-ring,02-Mar-22,6,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Its ok but that's all it really is. Its DS3 but with more build customization basically. So if you just want the same old Dark Souls but more content you'll be satisfied. But it isn't nearly as innovative as the press and streamers have made it out to be.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Combat hasn't taken any steps forward its still L1 Spam or R1 spam no real combos or varied movesets like Nioh has for example. Enviromental collision/obstacles is terrible with enemies reaching through whole walls and pillars as it always has been. Frames drop pretty consitently during combat even on framerate mode. But hopefully that'll be a simple patch here soon.<br/><br/>Not enough boss variety to fill the open world. They use many of the bosses 4 or more times throughout a single playthrough. With one of them being Asylum Demon from DS1. I mean come on we already had to fight him 3 times in that one 11 years ago now another 4 in this game?! Poise still sucks. I don't want broken DS1 poise where everyone havels but there really is no point in heavy armor if even hits that do almost no damage can stagger/stun lock.  Pros<br/>Atmosphere is the best its been for a souls game.<br/>Actually a decent number of NPCs to meet and have minor roles/quests with<br/>The new customizable flask is probably the best part/innovation.<br/>Map &amp; fast travel is an extreme improvement but I can't give them major credit for something that's been a feature in other games since 2005 lol.

24,elden-ring,02-Mar-22,2,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Anyone saying that graphics are not bad or ""there are no graphics issues on PS5 blah blah blah"" is either lying or needs to play other games, than just Souls games. These graphics are worse than any AAA game from 2015/2016. This is NOT something you can make arguments for or argue about. These are simple facts and you can verify them very easily by either playing older games or just checking Youtube videos of these games.
<br/>
<br/>Ironically outdated graphics are not the main issue with this game at all. My god, games in 2015 looked great. GTA 5 on PC that came out April 2015, looks still phenomenally good. So i have zero issues with 2015 graphics, i love 2015 graphics, but not on 2022 games, that should have 2022 graphics. Is this too complicated to understand for fanboys?
<br/>
<br/>But even then, i could play it with these graphics, if actual game itself was good. Sadly it's far, far from good. It's extremely mediocre, world is E M P T Y. There's nothing but empty areas between caves and monster locations and then you find some small ruins here or there. That's the whole map design. That's bad. That's amateur level or map designing.
<br/>
<br/>Story is there, but it's not nearly fun or interesting enough, that i would spend hours learning every boss move sets. I actually liked how bosses looked like (like their look, not how they make combos or whatever, but just how they look like). I think dragons looked way too basic, but some MAIN bosses, looked interesting enough. I almost got this anime vibe, that very first boss already feels like final boss, but actually there's countless of other bosses after him, who are ever stronger, bigger, etc.
<br/>
<br/>Sadly that wasn't enough for me, i wanted this game to be way more complex than just boss killing simulator, i wanted it to be deeper, i wanted it to be actually INTERESTING. I can tolerated difficult bosses, if game itself is interesting enough for me, to want to keep going. But this game doesn't have that. It doesn't have that ""Resident Evil 4"" (2005) vibe where there will be cool story moments after this epic boss fight, etc. There's none of that. If you beat the two bosses in castle, all you get is just another big swamp area full of random generic monsters for you to fight with. Too me that's so boring, so basic and so empty that i just didn't care anymore.
<br/>
<br/>In the end of the day, i will never play this game again, i didn't refund, i simply uninstalled it and went back to play some actually great games to get rid of that ""empty, meaningless"" feeling that Elden Ring left in me. I will never talk about this game again with anyone. I will never recommend this game to anyone and i will try to ignore that it ever existed, because it was that bland.</span>",39,86

34,elden-ring,28-Feb-22,4,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Geez this is a very overhyped game.  This is really just souls 3 open world.  The main positives are that many of the bigger enemies look really cool and have cool looking animations.  But there are A LOT of negatives.  Graphics look rough at times and do not have many of the polished features that other high profile games have such as good face animation or enviornment responding to what you do, very clunky fighting mechanics and I can't stress that enough, unnecessarily unforgiving boss fights, and many and I mean many reused bosses and enemies from past Souls games littered throughout.  In my opinion it seems the over the top and unbalanced difficulty is put in place to mask the clunky fighting mechanics and big flaws in the game.  Dark souls cultists will love this game and claim everyone who doesn't needs to GG and that they just don't like difficult games, but gamers who are used to other games whether they are very difficult or on the easier side, technical fighting games, and polished open world games will see this game as not designed for them hence the misleading marketing push for this game to try and sell it.  It would be one thing if I had fun playing this but I didn't.  I feel like I wasted my money on an expensive game.  I don't recommend getting this.<br/><br/>The fighting mechanics are the biggest disappointment for me because it's not really different.  When comparing the fighting mechanics to say Nioh 2, it was just boring.  Nioh 2 had waay more moves and a waay deeper fight system to perfect in a souls style kind of game.  Why didn't From Software learn from that?  The fighting mechanics alone should make this game not worthy of perfect reviews in light of Nioh 2 even from the cultists. And the reviews and marketing push on this game have really been misleading.  I suspect because they know most people will not enjoy playing this game's highly clunky fighting mechanics, unnecessary and unbalanced difficulty, and being left to deal with no tutorial except the From Software cultists.  Do you want a game that you have to look up how to find or get past anything every step of the way on YouTube? Most people would say I don't might doing that here and there but if the game is reliant on that because of how it was designed or poorly designed then no.  And anyone claiming this is like Breath of the Wild is an idiot.  Horizon Forbidden West is an easier game but it is a better designed game overall and should be easily beating this game rating wise.  Reviewers reeeally failed consumers that were not FS cultists on this and should be shamed for it.</span>",58,140

<br/>
<br/>Story is virtually non-existent they were happier than hell to plug George R R Martin's name all over the marketing materials, but I'm not sure what he did. About as much work as he does on his own series I'd surmise, which is NOTHING. You get what amounts to lore dumps on scrolls and flavor text on items passing as a ""story."" There's no major narrative structure.
<br/>
<br/>The ""revolutionary"" open world is hollow, lifeless, and boring. I've seen more intriguing open worlds in PS3 games. Speaking of PS3 games that's basically what you're getting here in the visuals department. I guess the AAA industry is so exhausted from bribing publishers and youtubers to give them good scores they don't even bother with the graphics anymore.

<br/>Gameplay is seriously bogged down by numerous bugs and technical issues. Frame rate drops, save crashing, stuttering, janky animations, clipping errors, you name it this game has it. I guess all the 10/10 reviews are based on where the game will be in 2 years once they fix the bugs? That's some optimism for you!

40,elden-ring,28-Feb-22,2,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Anyone giving this game a 10/10 is incapable of being objective about a game made by FromSoftware. For anyone who want Dark Souls in an open world, this game is for you. However this will not appeal to a large number of people. This is touted as being ""the most accessible Souls game ever"" which may in fact be the case. If it is, it still has a long way to go.
<br/>
<br/>The lack of markers on the map is supposed to ""give you more incentive to explore the world"" when in fact it just makes everything tedious. The lack of a quest log means that you have to manually keep track of any side quests, which is absolutely absurd that a game in 2022 doesn't have a quest log. I honestly can't even think of how that can be construed as a positive.
<br/>
<br/>In terms of graphics, it looks like a late PS3/early PS4 game and it has FPS issues even on PS5. The UI looks like something out of the early 2000s.
<br/>
<br/>As for the story, most of the side quests actually have a better story than the main story, which is kinda sad. You're likely either going to need a second playthrough or some googling to fully grasp the story, which is pretty bad game design. Don't take lessons from Kingdom Hearts when it comes to story.
<br/>
<br/>To summarize, if you like Dark Souls, you'll probably like this game. If you don't want to feel like the game you're playing is a chore, steer clear from this game.</span>",37,92

<br/>
<br/>If, like me, you have played this series since Demon's Souls, you will realise Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4. Or Demon's Souls 2 - It doesn't really matter at this point.
<br/>
<br/>Other than the *slightly* more open world structure (the 'Souls series was always somewhat open in structure) and Torrent the goathorse, everything is exactly the same as all the previous games, including elements from Bloodborne and Sekiro.
<br/>
<br/>Same player classes and animations?
<br/>Same enemy design, including enemy types/classes?
<br/>Same pseudo-mediaeval world, with lonely atmosphere?
<br/>Same dead-eyed, hollow-voiced NPCs?
<br/>Same controls and combat system?
<br/>Same telling of the opaque story and world lore through item descriptions?
<br/>Same, boring, grindy progression system?
<br/>Same die-and-die-again repetitive gameplay?

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>What specs you need to run it 60fps - 1080p or 4K, without stutter or lag?
<br/>- Honest answer is that, no matter how good your PC is, no matter, if you have PS5, this game will perform horribly and only thing you can do is wait for multiple patches.
<br/>
<br/>This game goes into same category of games, that have been extremely overhyped and extremely underdelivered. Other examples would be ""Cyberpunk 2077"", ""Fallout 76"", ""Anthem"", ""Battlefield 2042"" and ""Elden Ring"" is another fine addition to that list.
<br/>
<br/>So what new groundbreaking mechanics, graphics, open world design, innovative combat or interesting story this game offers? - Pretty much none of these.
<br/>
<br/>Graphically (for some weird reason) this game goes back to 2012/2013. But 2012/2013 had lots of great games and at times ""Elden Ring"" even looks beautiful, especially the sky, but ground and grass textures are pretty much worse than some 2013 games. For 2022 AAA release this is bad. Game that gets Metascores 95/97 in 2022, should have way more work put into it.
<br/>
<br/>Next up is open world design - There's extreme amount of boring looking, absolutely empty areas. This is automatically bad open world design, because these empty areas, that doesn't even look good have zero purpose to be there. Other areas that actually have something, okay let's make that clear, all that other areas have is trees and monsters. Endless amount of monsters that are simply sitting there, doing nothing, waiting for you to slay them. This is literally Runescape game design 101, i have been playing Runescape since 2004, i know what i'm talking about.
<br/>
<br/>Quests (if you can even call them) are extremely short, boring and you can literally ignore all of them. It's usually some lady asking you to go somewhere, get something, get it back to her. Most hilarious thing is that game doesn't show that you have completed any of them, which basically means that by the end of the game, you forget that you even did these. Runescape has more complex lore, quests and writing than this game can only dream of. Why i'm talking about Runescape and not Skyrim, you might ask - Well because lore wise, Skyrim would be too tough challenger for this game.
<br/>
<br/>Combat is extremely similar to Dark Souls 3, game that released 6 years ago. Same animations, same everything. Anyone who says in that case that ""Innovation is overrated"" has no right to criticize Rockstar or Ubisoft ever again, just saying.
<br/>
<br/>Anyone who says that having horse is innovative must be a troll, because having this empty open world without any transportation, would be almost insulting.
<br/>
<br/>All in all very weak release, only fun i had in this whole game were two boss fights - Margit and Godrick, i have to say they have extremely unfair combos, attacks and they are pointlessly difficult to beat, especially for 2 first bosses, but at least they have some interesting lore and cool monster design.
<br/>
<br/>1 point for beautiful sky design, 1 point for Margit boss design and 1 point for Godrick boss design.
<br/>
<br/>Overall score 3/10 - Not recommending, unless you have never played open world game before, but even then, you just could play older open world games that are way better.</span>",75,188
57,elden-ring,28-Feb-22,4,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">This is my first review on Metacritic. I really don't understand the professional metascore for this game.

I won't even talk about the music and the terrible voice acting of the characters you encounter along the way.

59,elden-ring,28-Feb-22,3,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Still dont understand why this game got so many 10/10 reviews. Played DS1,3, Sekiro and somehow I couldnt get much of a feeling that this game is a masterpiece like any other DS fan boys did. This game claims to be an open world game yet still there werent chances to feel that it actually is. Vastness of map became an stress and frustration since most of monsters you encounter are just the repetition of previous series. Even character's attacking motions are just same. Why would I have to suffer through this stressful world given that only reward is to feel the same thing in previous DS series? Elden Ring is playable on next gen console but graphic is just the same as DS 3 with only a little bit of upgrade. I see no progress on graphics when compared to another triple A games and this game got 97 out of 100 from critics? Hope I could refund it but cant because I already spent 2 hours trying to kill Tree Sentinel, which is, of course, totally ruined by poor optimization.</span>",49,123

Yeah the difficulty is way too hard to the point of being boring and frustrating to play.

65,elden-ring,03-Mar-22,0,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">DONT BUY. Melee dex is completely freaking useless I had to farm endlessly as a dex melee character to beat the second boss, I farmed til I was level 50 while he is like a level 20. Meanwhile mages are one shotting bosses. This game is just beyond awful. If you play a melee character you will die endlessly, as every boss and miniboss and strong normal mobs have aoe attack with tracing! Oh and also 80%+ are faster than you. Not to mention theres both input delay and input que take when you dodge roll for instance so the roll happens 0.5 sec later (great design in a reflex game, real genius) and regarding input delay you will die many a time due to your character deciding to do a command 2 commands ago.
<br/>
<br/>Also this games design is just awful, damn awful. Lets compare this awful game to some of my favorite games like take dota 2, (the real hardest game in the world not filled with BS mechanics) and diablo 2. In dota 2 all heroes are free and everyone is at equal footing since everyone can pick everyone. This means that even though you might die to another hero you can just spam that hero from now on and realise his strengths and weaknesses after 10-100 games.
<br/>
<br/>In diablo 2 theres this frustrating mechanic called hit recovery. What it does is it stunlocks you if damage taken exceeds 12% of max life. Now it can be very annoying getting stun locked to death, but this leads me to my point: in diablo 2 the enemys ALSO HAS HIT RECOVERY. IN OTHER WORDS ITS AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD. I CAN STUNLOCK THEM TO DEATH ALSO LEADING ME TO NOT GET MAD IF I GET STUN LOCKED TO DEATH COMPLETELY UNLIKE ELDEN RING, WHERE BOSSES HAVE ENDLESS STAMINA (unlike the melee characters who can only do 4 hits, or atleast samurai can only do that the character im playing..). Enemys also often 2 or 3 shot me while I have put the last 30 levels into damage through dexterity and gotten ONE damage point per level. ONE.
<br/>
<br/>This game isnt even hard like the fanboys claim (and then just insult you and tell you to get good when you call out bosses tracing you mid attack during a dodge roll) its just watching, waiting to get a single or two hits in if youre melee then trying to bait out the correct range to do it again. The bosses have much more fun than the player characters they actually have cool combos and skillsets and get to play the game, the player character just stands and runs around waiting for the bosses endless combos to end.

The graphics are mediocre for next gen consoles. Framerates are poor. Movement and mechanics are clunky. The art is generic and the story is non-existent. The only way I can see why people love this game is the challenge of the bosses and dungeons. But if you're not the type of person who enjoys dying to the same enemy 20 times in a row (I'm not), then there's much here to enjoy. This is basically a mediocre open world game with incredibly difficult and epic boss fights. Nothing more. It's mildly fun.

87,elden-ring,26-Feb-22,1,"<span>Same as all the previous Souls Games. There has been next to zero improvements in graphics from DS3, and the open world map is massive for no reason. I don’t get how you go from Sekiro to this.</span>",83,226
88,elden-ring,26-Feb-22,1,"<span>Disappointingly amateurish open world design, feels like i'm playing something from 2013, but it's not even top level 2013, more like somewhere in the middle. Awful framedrops, worst vegetation graphics i have seen in very long time, boss movements/animations  seem to be some random ""combo"" from all previous Souls games. Sky looks nice, but that's about it.</span>",94,257

90,elden-ring,26-Feb-22,3,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">It's like ""The Evil Within"" (2014), but bad. Really similar atmosphere, but something went wrong. People often say that ""The Evil Within"" is hard game (bosses are hard) and i have always ""kind of"" agreed, but i never cared when i died in ""The Evil Within"", because the whole game was extremely fun, so i always knew that whenever i beat this boss, there will be some cool new area after that, story goes on, etc. But even more, ""The Evil Within"" boss fight were actually fun, very challenging yes, but fun. Elden Ring is complete opposite. Nothing interesting happens after i beat this insanely overpowered boss and also, none of these fight are actually fun or enjoyable. All bosses in Elden Ring are extremely unfairly balanced against you. There's huge different between ""Challenging boss"" and ""Unfairly balanced boss"". Only boss you can't really kill (until you have met her at least 3-4 times) in The Evil Withing is Laura. She is also most difficult boss in the whole game, because she is ""one hit kill"" boss. The moment she touches you, you are dead. Is she unfairly balanced? NO. Because all you have to do is run away from her. That's the ""fight"", you have to be able to escape her and by the way, it's not easy at all. She can also teleport and she is extremely fast, so yeah, very challenging, but not unfairly balanced, because it's obvious what you have to do to beat her, there are rules. Elden Ring has zero rules. Most of these bosses in Elden Ring have completely randomized combos, attacks, special attacks, stuns, etc. That's what unfairly balanced means. You never know what they do. Never. They can have attack that hits you four times and right after that they hit you with some random combo, jump on you, etc. That's just nonsense. That's not fun, that's not enjoyable and that's why The Evil Within boss fights are fun and Elden Ring boss fight are not. This is obviously just my opinion, but i personally don't enjoy playing unfairly balanced games, so i rather stick to great games that actually make some sense.</span>",74,204

92,elden-ring,26-Feb-22,0,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">This game is a pile of garbage. The greedy developers copied and pasted the same animations from Dark Souls 3. The developers were too cheap and lazy to make new animations. The animations and graphics are very outdated for a next gen AAA $60 game. The AI is incredibly stupid. The developers were too greedy and lazy to make sophisticated AI, so they just gave the enemies too much health in a pathetic attempt at making the game difficult. This formula is getting so old. FromSoftware games aren't even that hard. All it takes to beat their games is learn the enemy patterns, dance around and have patience when attacking. There are clipping issues. I saw a monster's entire head magically go through a solid wall.
<br/>
<br/>There is nothing to do in the open world. Just an empty space full of grass, trees, and rocks. That is so boring to explore. Speaking of rocks, I tried jumping off a cliff so I can land on the other cliff, only for my player to get stuck in between and die. This awful bug could have easily been prevented had the developers add climbing mechanics. The developers are so lazy, they can't even add basic climbing mechanics. In what world does a modern AAA open world game lack climbing mechanics? That is embarrassing. It gets even more embarrassing when I encounter more game breaking bugs. I called my horse and hopped on It, only for my character to magically float in the air and stay stuck there to die. I experienced this bug multiple times. The physics are a joke. The plants don't even react to your movement, a basic feature many modern open world AAA games have. Even indie developers add that feature.
<br/>
<br/>The PvP multiplayer is complete trash and unbalanced. I had a player kill me, only because they had a character 20 times more powerful than mines. This game gets more unfair when I had an enemy AI killing me with a spear that was 5 inches away from my face. The game punishes me for terrible and lazy game design. $60 is too expensive for this poor expensive of a game. It is recycled trash and a cash grab. I don't recommend this game at all.</span>",43,171
93,elden-ring,08-Mar-22,10,"<span>God, this game is such a masterpiece, people that are leaving it a 0 because of the ""not a story"" obviously didnt play past the first 2 hours of the game, and leaving a 0 because of ""outdated graphics"" is the lamest of excuses, as if graphics made a game, be fair with your reviews</span>",4,4
94,elden-ring,08-Mar-22,10,<span>One of the best games ever made. It has immediately jumped to my top 3 after 75h of play.</span>,4,4
95,elden-ring,08-Mar-22,10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">It's basically just open world dark souls. I will warn you that if you don't like banging your head against a brick wall over and over again you will not like this. It's HARD.
<br/>
<br/>I don't like Fifa games, or CoD games, so I don't buy them and I don't play them, they're not for me. Some people really like spicy food, others don't. That's ok.
<br/>
<br/>This game might not be for you. I would caution you to really know what you're getting into without spoiling the world. The gratification comes from FINALLY beating a boss after it kicks your teeth in so many times. It's about giving that feeling of gratification. But you've gotta have a bit of a stubborn personality to get there. To me, this is the game I've been waiting on my whole life. It's like getting immersed in my favorite book (I like things like Malazan or WoT to get an idea). It's big, it doesn't tell you where to go, there's a ton of story to uncover, lore to learn, places to see, maps to create, and nothing is hand held.
<br/>
<br/>If you like that kind of thing, good luck, have fun, die a lot. If you don't, there's lots of games out there that you would enjoy instead that you should put your money towards. Just don't get mad at us fans because we don't often get to see something like this. It's a rare occurrence for us and we're gonna savor it.</span>",4,4
96,elden-ring,08-Mar-22,10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">I have played open world RPGs for over many, many years, and have found that there are two paths that major developers are beginning to take. Either you spam the map full of useless, copy-pasted quests that any monkey can joyfully trot around the map and complete in order to progress some half-assed ""story"", or the developers sink their heart and soul into it. I first thought this when I played some of the Elder Scrolls games, then most recently with Breath of the Wild, and now finally the genre is combined with one of my most beloved franchises, Dark Souls. We see this in it's most grandeur display with Elden Ring. This game has blown me away in every way. All of the greatest, honed combat from a decade of development shows up here in satisfying, beautiful gameplay. All of the crazy world and character design from Miyazaki and his team is still present, and takes lots of elements both from Bloodborne and the Souls games. This is without even mentioning all of the work that George R.R. Martin helped out with, story-wise. You can definitely see elements from A Song of Ice and Fire within many of the quests and stories intertwined in Elden Ring. Overall, the gameplay hooked me, the story held me, and the boss/world design knocked it out of the park. I hope Fromsoftware continues with IPs like this, with custom characters and free-to-roam worlds, because I truly believe they are a pioneer in this way. Great game.</span>",4,4

99,elden-ring,15-Mar-22,9,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">First of all, I HATE souls games... But I LOVE Elden Ring. If you've always wanted to like souls games but just couldn't, this might be for you. I'm now 80 hours in on my first playthrough, stuck on the very last boss. But I'll get him, someday. And in the meantime, there's just so much to do and explore in this beautiful open world filled with secrets. Is it challenging? Yes. Is it unfair? No. Is it rewarding? Very much yes.<br/><br/>The game wants you to think with your own head, it doesn't hold your hand like 99% of other games.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna lie, you need a commitment to this game. But if you commit, you will fall in love my fellow tarnished.</span>",3,3
