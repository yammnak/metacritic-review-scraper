4,elden-ring,"Feb 28, 2022",4,"it was supposed to be one of the best games ever but it didn't. From a technical point of view it has big problems both from the graphic point of view (it looks like a game of two generations ago) and from the performance point of view (the continuous drop in frames is unnerving). Incredible AI is also lost with NPCs and some bosses. The gameplay remains solid and clean. The last downside and perhaps the worst is the total recycling of assets as if it were a copy and paste. Had it been the sequel to dark souls 3 I would have also understood but not being the sequel, I find the recycling of assets in bad taste. Failed.",81,145

6,elden-ring,"Mar  6, 2022",5,"Definetly the worst game from the soul series, as it even gets to be called a ""soul series game"" even though it pretends (or was marketed pretending to) be something new and different. It is not. The game is a poor mixture of Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne and Sekiro. It's absolutely generic, as it copies infinite secondary and mini-bosses from the previous games. The game is an eternal liop in a poor open word, boring and repetitive, with no plot (contrary to what was sold, using the name of George R. R. Martin). After all that, graphics were far better on Demon Souls. Even still, the game struggles to load scenarios, hardly runs smooth on 60 fps using the performance mode and has a lot of issues. For example, I had one boss, wich was so generic I can't remind his name, being sanding still at his final 10% of life waiting for me to put him out of misery (wich was probably being a part of this game). Never seen such an overrated game. I only recomend it if you are in for some dark souls copied gameplay, wich may be fun. Don't expect more than that.",21,40

Played DS1,3, Sekiro and somehow I couldnt get much of a feeling that this game is a masterpiece like any other DS fan boys did. This game claims to be an open world game yet still there werent chances to feel that it actually is. Vastness of map became an stress and frustration since most of monsters you encounter are just the repetition of previous series. Even character's attacking motions are just same. Why would I have to suffer through this stressful world given that only reward is to feel the same thing in previous DS series? Elden Ring is playable on next gen console but graphic is just the same as DS 3 with only a little bit of upgrade. I see no progress on graphics when compared to another triple A games and this game got 97 out of 100 from critics?

People often say that ""The Evil Within"" is hard game (bosses are hard) and i have always ""kind of"" agreed, but i never cared when i died in ""The Evil Within"", because the whole game was extremely fun, so i always knew that whenever i beat this boss, there will be some cool new area after that, story goes on, etc. But even more, ""The Evil Within"" boss fight were actually fun, very challenging yes, but fun. Elden Ring is complete opposite. Nothing interesting happens after i beat this insanely overpowered boss and also, none of these fight are actually fun or enjoyable. All bosses in Elden Ring are extremely unfairly balanced against you. There's huge different between ""Challenging boss"" and ""Unfairly balanced boss"". Only boss you can't really kill (until you have met her at least 3-4 times) in The Evil Withing is Laura. She is also most difficult boss in the whole game, because she is ""one hit kill"" boss. The moment she touches you, you are dead. Is she unfairly balanced? NO. Because all you have to do is run away from her. That's the ""fight"", you have to be able to escape her and by the way, it's not easy at all. She can also teleport and she is extremely fast, so yeah, very challenging, but not unfairly balanced, because it's obvious what you have to do to beat her, there are rules. Elden Ring has zero rules. Most of these bosses in Elden Ring have completely randomized combos, attacks, special attacks, stuns, etc. That's what unfairly balanced means. You never know what they do. Never. They can have attack that hits you four times and right after that they hit you with some random combo, jump on you, etc. That's just nonsense. That's not fun, that's not enjoyable and that's why The Evil Within boss fights are fun and Elden Ring boss fight are not. This is obviously just my opinion, but i personally don't enjoy playing unfairly balanced games, so i rather stick to great games that actually make some sense.",74,204

96,elden-ring,"Mar  8, 2022",10,"I have played open world RPGs for over many, many years, and have found that there are two paths that major developers are beginning to take. Either you spam the map full of useless, copy-pasted quests that any monkey can joyfully trot around the map and complete in order to progress some half-assed ""story"", or the developers sink their heart and soul into it. I first thought this when I played some of the Elder Scrolls games, then most recently with Breath of the Wild, and now finally the genre is combined with one of my most beloved franchises, Dark Souls. We see this in it's most grandeur display with Elden Ring. This game has blown me away in every way. All of the greatest, honed combat from a decade of development shows up here in satisfying, beautiful gameplay. All of the crazy world and character design from Miyazaki and his team is still present, and takes lots of elements both from Bloodborne and the Souls games. This is without even mentioning all of the work that George R.R. Martin helped out with, story-wise. You can definitely see elements from A Song of Ice and Fire within many of the quests and stories intertwined in Elden Ring. Overall, the gameplay hooked me, the story held me, and the boss/world design knocked it out of the park. I hope Fromsoftware continues with IPs like this, with custom characters and free-to-roam worlds, because I truly believe they are a pioneer in this way. Great game.",4,4
