0,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",10,"<span>A real wonderful piece of art, enjoying almost every bit of it , definately worth a look.</span>",24,41
1,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",0,<span>This game gives you headache because of how bad it is.and gets repetitive so fast. Just worth a try on game pass</span>,27,112
2,Psychonauts 2,"Oct  5, 2021",9,"<span>Many thanks and love to the artists, devs and others behind this game, it is really good in many aspects. I didn't played the first title, however it hit me like the first time i heard the phrase ""the leader of the free world"". -1 because of the missing translations...</span>",2,2
3,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  7, 2021",10,<span>Absolutely delivered as a follow-up to the first one with 15 years worth of nostalgia and inflated expectations. Some of the most endearing character writing in a game I’ve experienced. I dream of a remake of the first game with this gameplay and graphical fidelity.</span>,2,2
4,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 30, 2021",10,"<span>Fantastic game. It does almost everything the first game does but better. I did miss a milkman-ish or boardgame type level, but the game offers other things that compensates. 10/10 best game I have played this year, and an instant classic.</span>",1,1
5,Psychonauts 2,"Dec 31, 2021",9,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">The level design, art direction, dialogue and music are all top notch. The level design specifically is some of the best I've seen - varied, clever, wowing. Psychonauts 2 is a worthy successor to Psychonauts and in those areas improves on part 1, while not disappointing in any of the other areas. It's close to a masterpiece and deserves a spot in Game of the Year lists.
<br/>
<br/>Its weak points are shared with #1 as well though - combat is there, and there's some new and better enemies, but it's not really challenging and it becomes a bit of a chore. The boss fights are well-designed, but also not particularly hard, although I found them entertaining - the rest of the combat gets a bit in the way of what is otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable game. The other thing I expected to have been improved upon was the accuracy of the platforming. It's not too easy or too hard, but sometimes it's hard because it's hard to see what you're doing and you feel like  you're just rolling the dice on a jump.
<br/>
<br/>Still, I'm sad I finished the game - I enjoyed every hour spent playing it, and there were a little over 30 of them, in which I completed the story and about 90% of all the collectables. I could (and probably will) spend another 5-10 hours completing everything.</span>",1,1
6,Psychonauts 2,"Sep 13, 2021",8,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">For those looking for a well-made 3D platformer that follows a good linear story, this is close to a must play. The levels ooze with creativity and character, from the themes to the actual challenges. The production values are also significantly higher than I imagined going in - this is in fact a big game, including an enormous overworld hub.
<br/>
<br/>It should be said, however, that the collectathon design is severely lacking at times, mainly because the worlds are a linear sequence of events rather than open wide spaces. The game will often trigger cutscenes without your input, forcing you to leave collectibles behind (even when they're on plain sight). i really have no problem with backtracking in games like this, but when the need to do so comes from this sort of pacing problem, it can lead to some frustration.</span>",1,1
7,Psychonauts 2,"Dec  9, 2021",9,"<span>This is great game: storytelling, design, but please add Russian language!!</span>",1,1
8,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 29, 2021",10,<span>Great game! Best platform ever made. Recommend to everyone. A good continuation of 1st part of psychonauts.</span>,1,1
9,Psychonauts 2,"Nov 12, 2021",6,<span>Rewelacyjna wizualnie i aranżacyjnie. Niestety zagadki są nieczytelne - zwłaszcza kłębki myśli. Zbyt wiele momentów kiedy nie bardzo wiadomo co robić.</span>,1,1
10,Psychonauts 2,"Nov  9, 2021",6,"<span>Not a bad game by any means but it's for those who care more for the art and story telling than the ones who seek quality gameplay and solid game mechanics, I don't like neglecting either and this game started feeling like a chore pretty fast...</span>",1,1
11,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",8,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Penso che Psychonauts 2 sia un buon gioco nella sua categoria di appartenenza, e cioè Platformer game! Riprende le macchine del primo, svecchiandole aggiungendo un gameplay molto più fluido! I personaggi sia il protagonista che i comprimari sono tutti molto ben caratterizzati. Certo ci sono cmq piccoli difetti, come alcuni cali di frame rate, poca reattività nel comando di evasione, durante i combattimenti e che è un mix di tanti giochi messi insieme, e che purtroppo non è per nulla originale! Lo consiglio cmq perché è molto divertente e piacerà sicurante agli amanti del genere.</span>",1,1
12,Psychonauts 2,"Jan  6, 2022",7,"<span>Some really good ideas, mostly esthetically. Game design feels inspired, but also kind of outdated. Everyone praised the writing, I think it's just ok.</span>",1,1
13,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",9,<span>Psychonauts 2 is a perfect sequel in my eyes it did everything i wanted it to.</span>,13,16
14,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",10,"<span>Sadly there appears to be weird review bombing on here. Honestly, everything and more I could have hoped for in a sequel. Same sort of idea but on a larger level. The platforming and combat are way tighter and more evolved. For anyone looking for a great controlling, super quirky, collectathon platformer with a lot of combat it's great.</span>",10,13
15,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">I  was waiting for the sequel for a 15 years and it was worth it — It's a very fun game in dialogues and gameplay as well. Storyline is great, characters are more catchy this time, but stories of the people is less violent then before, that's kinda sad. Gameplay is good and diverse, but too easy — especially the bosses. Design is great and overall look is good, tho textures need a little bit more details. Definitely recommend to buy it on a sale if you like platform games</span>",6,8
16,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  6, 2021",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">10 points, because it is an excellent game and there are more than 100 languages on the world. if you want to protest the missing localisation of a game, you can buy other games instead of that game. But downvoting a game, which you didn't play or which you liked is a behaviour to shame. it is a small studio and they didnt hide the available languages before the game released. for me, it is the best game i played in 2021</span>",6,8
17,Psychonauts 2,"Nov 15, 2021",10,"<span>A delicious journey through the human mind, with mechanics that alone are fun, but together they are simply fantastic.
<br/>a game that makes it clear once and for all that video games are a magnificent art form.</span>",3,4
18,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 28, 2021",10,"<span>It's been a since the last time a game just grabbed me. I loved the story, the levels are just so freaking awesome. And just the ideas behind it was just wonderful start to finish.</span>",5,7
19,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  1, 2021",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">If you want to see real reviews of this game - go to steam store page. 99% of negative feedback here is written by exceptionalists that whine about game having no russian localization (just like 100+ other languages, but it doesn't matter for them). You aren't required to have this game in order to rate it 0 or 10 here, me is a perfect example, but steam have better approach. Go there and read real player's opinions, not hate mob agenda.</span>",5,7
20,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 30, 2021",10,"<span>16 years of waiting, 16 hours of completing the story and side quests. Thank you, uncle Shafer, for this magnificent two-part story!
<br/>
<br/>P.S.Sorry for the Russian community, we are not all like that :(</span>",7,10
21,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Впервые ставлю оценку на метакритике ради того, чтобы поддержать любимых разработчиков данного шедевра.

23,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",10,"<span>the reviews for this game is insane it is not a 0. this game is a great platformer, and the characters and levels are very refreshing. one of the better platformers i played this year.</span>",6,9
24,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",10,<span>2021 GOTY CONTENDER THIS GAME IS AMAZING (STORY GAMEPLAY GRAPHIC ART STYLE ..ETC ) ALL FELLS AMAZING WITHOUT MENTIONING THE INCREDIBLE LEVEL OF CREATIVITY. TIM AND DOUBLE FINE DID A GREAT JOB AND GLAD IT REVIEWED WELL<br/>Big W FOR THE PLAYERS  AND FOR  XBOX TO HAVE THIS AMAZING DEVS FROM DOUBLE FINE UNDER THEIR UMBRELLA AND CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEIR NEXT PROJECT THAT THEY WAS TEASING</span>,6,9
25,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Amazing game. Beautiful graphics. I don’t know why this game is getting so much hate. This is an amazing game don’t look at the negative reviews. The graphics are alright story is amazing. Gameplay is also great but is a little clunky. There are 30 years old complaining the game is too cartoonish. If you are on Xbox or pc use game pass.  If you are playing on PlayStation then you have no option but buy it. Game pass is an amazing service</span>",6,9
26,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,<span>Fun gameplay and great humour. Can't stop playing. One of the most exciting games this year</span>,6,9
27,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,<span>Same original cast 16 years later. Same craziness. Psychonauts 2 is already a classic.</span>,6,9
28,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"<span>Эту игру я ждала 16 лет, так что отсутвие перевода не мешает насладиться игрой. Я благодарна разработчикам и всем, кто поддерживает этот проект.</span>",6,9
29,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"<span>Fantastic 3D platformer adventure ! the art style is really unique and imaginative, the gameplay and level design are amazingn the collectibles, secrets, all that is a call back to the old school era of Platformers, and is really funny, characters are likable and each of them has its own personality. Raz especially is a really likable character</span>",4,6
30,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  6, 2021",10,<span>Honestly think it's more of a 7.5/10 but it needs so good ratings since it's getting review bombed by angry Russian players for not having Russian subs but nothing to do with the quality of the game</span>,4,6
31,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",10,"<span>Sad console war people gotta review bomb this. Don't listen to the bad reviews, this game is a masterpiece.</span>",4,6
32,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",10,"<span>Another masterpiece from Doublefine. Simple but deep history, great gameplay and the graphic style is awesome. 10/10.</span>",4,6
33,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",10,"<span>From graphics to gameplay, game is very fun and enjoyable. I like the original story themes. At the very least try the game on game pass and see for yourself.</span>",4,6
34,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",10,"<span>Excellent gameplay, mechanics are well polished and graphics are beautiful, so far I haven't experienced any frame drop</span>",4,6
35,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"<span>Great gameplay, creative and often laugh out loud funny. Transcends the platform genre.</span>",4,6
36,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"<span>Jogo extremamente divertido. Arte perfeita. jogabilidade boa e de fácil aprendizagem, historia super divertida. Jogue sem medo.</span>",4,6
37,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"<span>El mejor sin duda en todos los sentidos, jugabilidad, escenarios y banda sonora!</span>",4,6
38,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"<span>Add Russian subtitles, please. Generally add more subtitle options to the game for more languages.
<br/>Currently the best game of the year. Very creative, interesting and in it each level is done differently.</span>",4,6
39,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,<span>A beautiful game that offers such great gameplay and the levels are so fantastically creatively designed!</span>,4,6
40,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  2, 2021",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">I just got done playing and beating this original, wholesome game. Don't listen to the negative reviews. They all are mad Playstation fanboys who banned together to poop on this game. But do yourself a favor and play this game. It really is amazing the amount of love that went into this game. You won't regret playing. Not only is Raz ""the main character"") voiced by the guy who played invader Zim, but Grr also makes a guest appearance . You will just want to love the colorful charecters</span>",4,6
41,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  3, 2021",10,"<span>This game is incredible and I didn't unerstand all the negative reviews. Looking at the list I see a LOT of people review bombing because there's no Russian. Didn't realize Russia felt so strongly about Raz and co. Was the original game in Russian? Have they said anything about patching it in later? Sorry I know nothing about localizations, I just like the game.</span>",4,6
42,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  5, 2021",10,<span>A master piece of art. It's quite dirty what Russians are doing with negative review bombing just because they dont have subs in Russian. For them it seems the quality of a game is directly proportional to the goodness of Russian traduction it has.</span>,4,6
43,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  6, 2021",6,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">While mechanically this is an improvement on Psychonauts in almost everyway, instead of getting rid of the things that didn't work well in the original it ports them over as well. There is some good humor and world building sprinkled throughout the game but the good parts are few and far between. The story is good in the sense that it brings the loose ends from the first game and ties them up but nothing about the story or the characters is as fun or interesting as in the first game. It's been several decades since the release of the first Psychonauts game but I can still remember nearly every world and character and how interesting everything was. It's been a few days since I played Psychonauts 2 last and while I can dredge up memories of the characters and some of the levels I would be hard pressed to say who those characters actually are and what about that particular world was fun and interesting. Tim and Double Fine have shown that they know their way around modern game engines and that they can still make a AAA game. It's just a shame that they can't make it as interesting as they used to.</span>",2,3
44,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  4, 2021",10,"<span>One of the best games I've played for the last couple of years!
<br/>Lot of fun, visual design, characters, story - it has it all. And TONS of adult jokes masked for innocent phrases - so kids won't get them :)</span>",2,3
45,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 27, 2021",10,"<span>It's amazing, everything you expect from DoubleFine and more. The best art style, writing and music in the business, along with clever puzzles and just enough platforming to raise the stakes and provide a challenge.
<br/>
<br/>This is the first game in years that I've stopped to soak in all the details and WANT to hear every line of dialogue.</span>",2,3
46,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  2, 2021",10,<span>Game is pretty fun ngl it's my first of the franchise and I'm liking it a lot. I'll never understand how people can not like this game. Top 3 best platformers in recent years.</span>,2,3
47,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 28, 2021",10,"<span>The best game series I ever played. Great humor, great characters and story. An unusual view of human mind. The gameplay is amazing and constantly brings something new. I will definitely go play it again and again.</span>",2,3
48,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 28, 2021",10,<span>Un juego que no farda de graficasos pero si de un nivel artístico alucinante divertidísimo.</span>,2,3
49,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 28, 2021",10,"<span>A perfect followup from the Doublefine team. The first time in ages I've desperately hoped for a DLC announcement, so I can shovel more of this series into my brain.</span>",2,3
50,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 28, 2021",10,"<span>Most of the features of the first part have been added and improved. The developers care a lot about the fans of the game, so they kept the voice acting familiar to us from the first part!</span>",2,3
51,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  9, 2021",10,<span>Russian people are absolutely disgusting and they rigged the 2016 election. 10/10 thank you double fine for acknowledging Russians are filth</span>,2,3
52,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  1, 2021",10,"<span>This game is amazing! It's marvelously psycho, and pretty humorous. I really enjoyed it</span>",2,3
53,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  2, 2021",10,"<span>its so addictive and the art of the game i so pretty, i liked a lot the part of the senses, and the changes of perspectives are a great touch!</span>",2,3

59,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 26, 2021",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">The user reviews for this game are exactly what is wrong with this website and user reviews in general. Half of them are about the game not being translated in Russian and the other half you can check for yourself. Now realistically this game is not a 10 ( I'd give it a 9 at best, still a great game) but I have to even out the chalk eating basement dwellers who rated this game 1 just because it's ""not translated in Russian"" or "" the graphics are not next gen "".</span>",9,14

<br/>The story explores, subjects like addiction, anxiety and PTSD in lighthearted manner, that is eye opening and doesn't make you depressed. These themes are also presented through distinct characters and a very creative and artistic level design, that looks great with Unreal engine.

<br/>Joking aside, I love this game. It has clever writing with a focus on mental health and empathy, smart level design, colorful characters, funny dialogue, great voice acting and soundtrack.
<br/>I'd recommend playing (or watching if you don't have VR) The Rhombus of Ruin for backstory and of course the first game if you missed it.
<br/>Psychonauts 2 isn't perfect, I'd give it a 9 but I'm rating it 10 to counter the ridiculous Russian review bombing. It's my native language too and I'm not complaining that a Russian translation isn't available now. The original Psychonauts had one but AFAIK they never promised it for the sequel. Hopefully they'll add it (fan projects are on the way) but I don't think the attitude I'm seeing in some of the user reviews will help.</span>",1,2
102,Psychonauts 2,"Nov  9, 2021",10,"<span>This is my GOTY so far. It's by far the best platformer I ever played. It's extremely creative, it has a perfect story, lovable characters, fantastic gameplay.</span>",1,2
103,Psychonauts 2,"Sep 12, 2021",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Most of the negative scores are coming from Russian language shippers who can't accept that they aren't a first-class market for anything. I'm somebody who hasn't enjoyed platformers in general because I find them boring when they're not too difficult... either way a downer. But Psychonauts 2 is to platformers what WoW was to RPGs... a whole universe better! It's a bit short of an open-world MMO/RPG, but the writing and art are outstanding. You can turn combat damage down or off and just enjoy the jumping puzzles and the story line. Every part of this story has its own unique style and challenges. Don't miss it!</span>",1,2
104,Psychonauts 2,"Sep 27, 2021",8,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Microsoft by putting this game on the game pass has really showcased the xbox game pass as a Potential future, however at the same time due to not ensuring the games are of equal quality on both game consoles has made me sad as I wouldn't have played this on PC but my PS5 and paid more cash for it to own it.
<br/>
<br/>I kind of predicted the twist.  The story is charming, the art in some areas is stunning. The combat is overly difficult in some areas but the game does have an invisibility mode and yes I couldn't be bothered with the nuances of combat.  You can remap most of the game's powers to any buttons and its often a requirement.  I do which jumping was a little less annyoing in some areas and or you could set an end destination of a jump with a button press and have the game assist your jump (providing it was possible to do it in the first place).
<br/>
<br/>The Song by PSI king gets interrupted and not finished, which makes me a little sad.  - The game is left open for the future which is a good thing.    I do hope we see some sought of teleportation ability in psychonauts 3.
<br/>
<br/>This game however does annoy me as it's not technically 2 as there was the game Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin which sadly hasn't been implemented as a non-VR title meaning there is a gap filled in the story at the start with a cheap comic book.
<br/>
<br/>The pins allow cosmetic changes which are nice but might have been better if they affected powers in different ways e.g reverse ignite into freeze or ignite to electricity.
<br/>
<br/>It would have been nice if you could use your doppelganger to collect collectibles from far away by conjuring them on a different platform and using clairvoyance to take control of your clone.
<br/>
<br/>The game is great in a lot of areas and especially worth playing on game pass but something did get lost between 1 and 2 but I can't put my finger on it. It gained stuff but lost something too. Maybe they needed to develop the side characters more or bring back the old campers rather than make new characters.   I rank this an 8 because of the game development's stance of not being equal for both consoles as clearly it would have been better for Microsoft to prove that games they make are good or both platforms and why you should to pick up an xbox over a sony console one day.  Death loop most likely will be improved in someway when the exclusivity with sony ends but if Microsoft is smart it will keep it on par with the ps5 version to gain more customers over the long term.  Playing this game for a rental cost of 7 is not a bad deal and I would have most likely given it 9 if it was not for some platforming sections or the fact that they didn't make xbox and ps5 version the same standard.</span>",1,2
105,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 28, 2021",10,"<span>Tremendo. De lo mejor de la generación. Más juegos como este, donde la creatividad y calidad se cogen de la mano.</span>",1,2
106,Psychonauts 2,"Oct 22, 2021",7,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">My main problem with P2 stems from the underlying sense of cynicism and bleakness which pervades the characters and world. Sure there's the kooky off-hand humour (which sometimes but not always hits the mark), but too many characters are introduced, and I didn't really find any of them particularly likeable. Some of the levels are overly dark too (vomiting hand puppets).
<br/>
<br/>It feels like many of the level premises and layouts were just cobbled together during brain-storming sessions where someone eventually said ""Yeah, that'll do"". Add this sense of listlessness to the ""collect-em-up"" structure, and the game feels like it lacks structure or drive. Many recent games are guilty of having too many collectibles and objectives to keep you playing longer instead of engaging with the actual gameplay, and this is an action platformer so it's expected, but still, there are LOTS of things to collect in this game and they artificially extend the play time vastly - More chore than fun. Some of the levels feel original, but many are almost re-skinned versions of others.
<br/>
<br/>For a game where you go into people's minds and literally anything is possible, it seems like there aren't many new ideas here, gameplay-wise. There's a decided lack of mini games (bowling alley with no real bowling, for example) too. It's a shame, really, as I remember enjoying the first, and these single-player platformers can be excellent with a decent story and tight controls, but this seems to be a bit washed out and convoluted. Some invisible walls too and awkward movements, although some of the powers you get are cool. The graphics are fine and the voices and sound are good too.
<br/>
<br/>Hopefully if there's another, more time will be spent on original concepts for gameplay and levels rather than packing in too many things to collect and needlessly repetitive brains - There's not much point making things look funky and interesting without having varied and fun gameplay to back it up.</span>",1,2

<br/>
<br/>The music in the game is forgettable and generic (Grulovia track is good). Psychonauts 1 whispering rock music, lodge music, night music is incredibly atmospheric and makes you feel immersed in the world. In Psychonauts 2 the music in the Quarry area is painful to listen to while looking for collectibles and makes you want to turn audio off.
<br/>
<br/>There are also several annoying bugs like Raz hanging animation on swings and not being able to collect certain emotional baggage in the Compton level. Overall the game does not have the feeling Schafer managed to create in the first game, the feeling that there is something more to the world and the characters, a certain level of mystery and depth that just isn't present in Psychonauts 2. I rate the game 5/10 as the graphics are nice and the gameplay is good, but the difficulty is a joke, the in-game economy is easily broken, the story is lackluster and feels like a generic Marvel movie.

If you think of think of the open world between puzzles are a map screen, it's okay I guess, but a little more work than is necessary to get around. There are also collectables shoehorned in which the game really wouldn't suffer without, but this is pretty common for anything within the last 15 years. All in all, if you have XBox game pass on PC, it's well worth your time. If you have to buy outright, I'd wait for a modest sale. It's probably worth a good $45. That said, it's refreshing to play a platform/puzzle game with a relatively big budget on a modern machine. Of course there are plenty of small indie games in this genre. However, the top tier fare is typically some variation of fight/shoot/open world — which can get pretty old — or multiplayer — which doesn't particularly interest me as I have a full-time job and don't enjoy being pwned for 13 year-olds with lots of free time.</span>",1,8

165,Psychonauts 2,"Aug 28, 2021",5,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Attention! This review will contain spoilers and discussion of plot clippings. Also, I will not discuss the absence of the Russian language and graphics, because even the first part of the Russian language was officially absent, only from the publisher in the CIS space ""Buka"". Changing and improving graphics is a natural process.
<br/>
<br/>And now, let's start with the main advantages - the style, compared to Psychonauts 1, although it has become better, is still recognizable. The gameplay is interesting at first, Double fine fixed its mistakes from the previous game. Combat from simple blows and shield, or psi - blaster and invisibility has become more varied. Now there is a wide variety of enemies that, in order to effectively deal damage, you need to constantly change abilities, for the judge - telekinesis and psi - a blaster, for a panic attack - a time bubble and mental connection, and so on.
<br/>
<br/>The most memorable minds are the TV show ""Ram It Up!"" and that colorful world of sensations.
<br/>
<br/>But now - cons
<br/>
<br/>Plot: nothing more than an attempt to copy the story of the first part, just with unnecessary complication. It turned out badly, because after passing the game there are many questions, and the most important ones are what kind of kingdom of Grulovia is and how can the Middle Ages and high technologies be located at the same time? What was the relationship between Lucy and Ford for? To justify Ford hiding Lucy's bad memories and introducing Raz's dad-to-be? Is this such a lead to the fact that Raz is actually Ford's grandson?
<br/>Why do we need Nick? Indeed, in fact, at the end of the game, he simply disappears. It doesn't just fall somewhere, it just disappears. Moreover, he is nothing more than a complicated version of Dr. Loboto, only he was obsessed with teeth, and this one - on expensive eggs (to be more precise, on caviar) and desires to restore Grulovia with the help of Margulias. Most likely, the developers were too lazy to create a villain for the next game, and therefore they made it so that at the end Nick just disappeared. Or, they didn't have enough time (6 years were not enough for them! What a disgusting thing! It is time for them to reorganize the development team if this happens) to finish this character.
<br/>Anyway, there is a feeling that the characters, their relationships and the last levels after the restoration of Ford were done as quickly as possible, but about the levels later.
<br/>Interns are just blanks that at the beginning did not recognize us, and at the end - abruptly, without dialogue, our best friends. The relationship between the main 6 psychonauts is more or less. Except for Bob Zanotto and Helmut Fullbier's relationship. They serve nothing more than a useless agenda, and the reason why they got married was because Bob liked his singing.
<br/>
<br/>Levels: All the levels that come after the restoration of Ford are boring and not memorable, contains no collisions in some places and look faded. That's all.
<br/>
<br/>Abilities: Removed shield, invisibility, and confusion grenades. Nerfed levitation, changed pyrokinesis. Of the new abilities, only the time bubble is interesting, it is used in platforming and in combat. Mental connection as puzzles is used only once - in the second consciousness. The rest of the times are for collecting items, fighting and moving. Mental projection is a thing for puzzles and lulz, at least it's cute.
<br/>
<br/>collectibles: Safes with memories have become unnecessary, because the characters themselves tell the information from them. In the first game, we were told, using safes, the backstory of those whose brains we visited, and also (if we collected all the emotional baggage) - the creation of these characters as sketches. By the way, about the emotional baggage - in the second part he gives only - just a rank for the complete collection. half - a - drain replacement of brain cans.
<br/>
<br/>Bosses are scripts that repeat three times. Wait for the enemy to stop attacking you and let the script execute. Regular battles are only for mini bosses, when, as in the first part, half of the bosses had to be beaten yourself.
<br/>
<br/>Bottom line: the first half was interesting to play, but then everything starts to go wrong. the night I finished the game, I was lying on the couch, my head was splitting and I was angry. thank goodness i got this game at game pass and i didn't pay 60 dollars.
<br/>
<br/>only for the first half I bet 5/10</span>",0,2

The writing seems to come from a school of first introducing a character and then immediately solving all of their problems. There is little-to-no room for any relationships or character arcs to develop. Would I play Psychonauts 3, no matter how much it costs? Yes, absolutely. But let's be clear: Psychonauts 2 is a regression in storytelling (the first was much, MUCH stronger) and a lateral move in terms of gameplay (at best).

177,Psychonauts 2,"Feb 14, 2022",8,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Psychonauts 2 is the very, very long awaited sequel to Psychonauts, a game about a kid who ran away from the circus to go to a psychic summer camp. It was a quirky 3D platformer of the kind that existed back in the day, but which pretty much disappeared.
<br/>
<br/>Come 15+ years later, Psychonauts 2 was one of maybe two (if you’re generous) 3D platformers to come out in 2021. How times have changed.
<br/>
<br/>Set immediately after the first game and the VR-only Rhombus of Ruin (which isn’t necessary to play, as the game does a recap of what happened during that game), you get to Psychonauts headquarters, only to find out that you are not, in fact, a “real” Psychonaut, but actually an intern. But trouble is afoot (or is that abrain?) at HQ, and as things go on, you uncover a bunch of new secrets that tie back into the first game, as well as expand the universe of the series.
<br/>
<br/>Psychonauts 2 is a 3D platformer which alternates between real world segments, in a hub world, and going into people’s minds and exploring their mindscapes. These levels are where the real meat of the game is, and are both varied and creative… sometimes.
<br/>
<br/>See, the problem is, this game varies between “this is a really cool premise for a level” and “this is just a trip through memory lane… again”. This is a problem, because some of the levels are, frankly, only okay. For every level where you go into a quirky cooking show or fight your way through a hospital that is also a casino, there’s a level where you walk through a bunch of quilts and see memories, or walk through a long hallway that consists of a bunch of memories and the locations they took place in.
<br/>
<br/>This is particularly odd as some of them are of very significant people and events. The first game’s levels were not always the best, but they often had very memorable premises; however, many of the levels in this game are pretty forgettable, even if the game is a bit improved mechanically.
<br/>
<br/>The humor of the story as well feels weaker. The first game was very Saturday morning cartoon and was very silly, and while this game is also silly, it deals with much darker subjects – like fictional Eastern European dictatorships – that the game ends up dwelling on for a very, very long time. The first game had some darker subject matter, but mostly was lighter and more quirky; this game spent too long in the darkness, I think, and suffered for it.
<br/>
<br/>It’s not that there’s anything wrong with more serious games – I’ve liked a number of them over the years, after all!
<br/>
<br/>The problem lies in the fact that the game is fundamentally relying on a bunch of rather silly character designs and a rather silly world, so throwing in too much serious stuff feels like the game is at odds with itself, as you have a bunch of silly-looking characters talking about something that was essentially genocide in a game that isn’t really sure if it is for kids or not.
<br/>
<br/>All that being said, I thought that it was an interesting experience overall. I did guess the major plot twist very early on in the game, but a number of the levels were interesting, even if some of the others failed to really deliver as interesting of backdrops. The overall platforming was okay, though not amazing – the game is easier than the first game, and more consistent in its difficulty, with nothing like the first game’s Meat Circus floating around to cause you trouble. You have infinite lives and an enormous amount of health if you bother buying the upgrades and searching around a bit, and as a result, the game itself is actually very easy overall. There are some pits you can fall into, but I rarely fell in for any reason other than trying to make jumps I wasn’t supposed to be making.
<br/>
<br/>The powers you get in this game are decent, but the limit of having only four equipped at once is annoying; you basically always need to have the levitation power equipped due to the float it gives you, and once you get the time power, it is so good that you’d be a fool NOT to have it equipped. That leaves you with only a couple power slots to play with for most of the game, and as a result, some powers ended up getting used far more than others, though all of them were useful at least sometimes.
<br/>
<br/>The platforming was decent, which is an accomplishment for a 3D platformer, but it never really rose to the level of something like Super Mario Odyssey. Still, it is okay, and better than games like A Hat in Time or Yooka Laylee.
<br/>
<br/>Overall, this is a decent but not amazing sequel to an older game that had its flaws but also its positive quirks. I liked it well enough, but it’s not the “must play” game that I think it seemed like it might have been at one point. Still, if you did like the first game, this is good enough that it is worth getting; if you haven’t played the first game, and you like 3D platformers, this might be worth a look.</span>",0,0

<br/>Go play this game
<br/>Psychonauts 2 is a 12 an a half hour long 3D platformer and is one of the best games of the year..
<br/>Taking place just days after the First psychonauts game, you play as Razputin, theres a moele in the psychonauts so you set out to at first, sneakily get to the bottom of this..
<br/>I was impressed with how the game manages to not pretend like you magically forgot all of the powers you learned in the first game, you get them all almost instantly with a little hey, remember that thing you can do, that would be helpful here.. as well as introducing new abilities tht make for some interesting puzzles early on..
<br/>And for better or for worse psychonauts 2 feels very much like a PS2 game.. there is no handholding here, The game takes place in a semi open world where you have to find a cast of charcters and enter their minds for the more linear parts of the game.. so you ve to figure out what to do with whatever the previous character told you.. no arrows, no spot marked on the map, just go find them.. but once you do and things get rolling, psychonauts 2 is a blast… now there isn’t as much variety gameplay wise as there was in the first game as you were learning new abilities, so it sticks to straight up 3d platforming with new elements here and there based on the new power, but the game still manages to feel fresh throughout, even throwing you into a cooking show for one level.. and one of my favorite moments when I knew I loved this game was going through this dark forest in search of some bees..
<br/>Theres so much charm here, such a special game..
<br/>My only complaing with Psychonauts 2 is the combat, it just isn’t that fun, you have so many powers but only 4 action buttons so you have to constantly remap depending on certain enemies, and I feel enemies are just so spongy for how much the game asks of you, but there are accessibility optiosn to make you invincible if youre just over a section or don’t care to deal with the annoying combat, but definitely turn this off for boss battles, because these moments are really fun and special and youll be missing out not giving them your all.
<br/>Psychonauts 2 is a really special game full of charm and humor.

196,Psychonauts 2,"Dec 21, 2021",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Nunca joguei e nunca havia ouvido falar do primeiro Pshychonauts. Quando vi as indicações a jogo do ano no The Game Awards, resolvi pesquisar sobre, e acabei me interessando, principalmente por ser do gênero de plataforma; já estava no gamepass, não custava nada experimentar. Acabei por ter uma das melhores experiências com jogos no ano.
<br/>
<br/>Não se enganem pela falta de popularidade do jogo ou pelas notas dos usuários, Psychonauts 2 é facilmente um dos melhores jogos de plataforma 3D já feitos. Todas as fases criadas são diferentes e divertidas de se jogar; você realmente fica ansioso para descobrir qual será o próximo mundo a ser apresentado.
<br/>
<br/>A jogabilidade, apesar de não ser complexa e nem muito diferente de outros jogos do gênero, ela é extremamente fluida e divertida; cada movimento é satisfatório de se fazer, e isso é uma característica fundamental para qualquer jogo do gênero. O estilo de arte escolhido também funciona muito bem, no qual consegue transformar até mesmo os coletáveis em algo atraente no mapa.
<br/>
<br/>E por incrível que pareça, até mesmo a história do jogo é boa, uma característica  não muito comum em jogos desse tipo. Para entendê-la não tem necessidade de jogar o primeiro; logo no começo há uma explicação resumida, porém em muitos momentos percebi que se eu fosse fã certamente curtiria as referências e entenderia melhor alguns detalhes - algo normal vindo de uma continuação.
<br/>
<br/>Há apenas dois pontos que considero negativo: a trilha sonora e a otimização em consoles de 8º geração. As músicas, apesar de combinar com o contexto, são bem esquecíveis e pouco inspiradas; já a otimização nos consoles de 8º geração (Xbox One e PlayStation 4) me pareceu ter sido jogada de lado, pois graficamente Psychonauts 2 é abaixo de muitos se comparado a outros. Um jogo de plataforma precisa de 60fps; jogar há 30fps nativamente é deplorável.
<br/>

There are people who can appreciate the towering creativity of these games, and others who can't, and just judge them as just another platformer--and as a platformer, it admittedly is just average. That's not where the genius lies.  It's the crazy surreal environments, concepts and story which set these games apart.  These are games where you can enter into a cartoon character's crazy mind, see what makes them tick, and in that surreal landscape you can casually meet another character, go into THEIR mind and find an even larger and more surreal landscape.  It does ""Inception"" better than Christopher Nolan ever even tried, and before he tried. These games remove me farther from reality than any other games, and I give massive credit for that.</span>",0,0

240,Psychonauts 2,"Sep  2, 2021",9,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">One of the best things I've played so far in 2021.
<br/>
<br/>Gameplay is fluid, funny and it always reminds you the original one. Story is not a big big deal, but it's entertaining and funny to follow along. The scenarios, the minds, that's the interesting thing, in combination with how minds work inside. It's a beautiful game, giving you another perspective of the mind of the people.
<br/>
<br/>The music is not something too noticeable or special. The characters are good, the game likes to make an emphasis on the original Psychonauts: making you love them and understand them as you were them. The comedy in this game is glorious!
<br/>
<br/>It goes its flaws as any game that's not Dark Souls (okay, bad joke). Sequel uses at least the half of the psychic powers from the first one, which is not bad but it's been 15 years, we were expecting to see Raz learning how to use more and more psychic powers.

249,Psychonauts 2,"Sep 21, 2021",6,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">With pretty positive yet demanding mindset I finished this game for 100% activities and have my verdict. There's a point mentioning I think of original ”Psychonauts” as one of the most enjoyable games I played, and though I tried it long ago, it was around 5 years ago when I cleared it.<br/><br/>So, back to ”Psychonauts 2”. I should start with advantages I found, and first one is probably graphics. Though it never is my priority, I think they did a good job here. Also I like plot. It has moments that were pretty interesting to watch and think about what I just learned. Also there's a lot of voicing work done, main character have a lot of things to say, funny comments, — though length of game really allows it.<br/><br/>So, what made me rate it with 6? First of all, half of game levels were really boring. It is funny to see actual attempt into weed trip, just to realise all the colors and cosmic vibes are so uninteresting. I don't see heart put into much of the game. I only really like one world, mainly because it's so reach at beautiful landscapes. Plus real world is pretty good itself. I don't like newer characters, maybe three of them are done good, but many others lack anything I could connect with. Compared to what previous game managed it's massive downgrade. Also the battling is not challenging at all. I know it's platformer, and because of clever decisions with it I would probably give it 6.5 if I could, but it's a shame upgrading abilities actually makes it less of a fun to do fighting.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm disappointed. Of course those who never played original will find some pretty creative things done here, but those who did will realize how they wrecked many of possibilities they had. And the situation when you don't understand most of little plot details without knowing previous game plot only adds to controversy. I would give it 7 for the bravery those people had starting crowdfunding and taking 5 years to make what they wanted to make. But we rate the result, not just effort, do we</span>",0,0
250,Psychonauts 2,"Oct  3, 2021",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">I'm not a great reviewer. I set my bar somewhere in the middle for all games. I think that this game does what it sets out do to do very well. The art style compliments the humor of the game in an interesting way. There are many nuanced adult jokes and themes even when on the surface this seems like a kids game. This is a game that all can enjoy (as long as you don't need it in Russian because apparently it doesn't support that). Several levels had me wishing I was playing while on several drugs as the tones of the game throw you about in a bizarre adventure. I have never played the first of the series and I don't think you need to play the first to get caught up in this one. I will watch for other titles from this developer in the future.</span>",0,0

It is an absolutely amazing game with great gameplay, level designs and combat systems. None of the new games try anything new nowadays but this game goes far and beyond. Every single level is different and I mean it, nothing is recycled and every level feels so fresh. You can revisit the old levels for collectible adding replayability to the game. The characters are weird and charming in their own way but the colorful level designs and platforming is what keeps the game fresh throughout. Every time I felt, oh that was cool, the game throws something even more amazing at me in the next level. The character dialogue system is great which might not make you laugh but does put a smile on the face. The story is engaging and keeps you guessing. The endgame is very well done and the story teaches a lot about emotions, pain, loss, anxiety, depression, fear and the human psychology. Do play this game, you are going to love it</span>",0,0
253,Psychonauts 2,"Oct 13, 2021",9,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">Here's how good the original Psychonauts was and still is: Psychonauts 2 is a very pale imitation and is still game-of-the-year material. Now to offer some fair criticism: the overworld does not play into the story at all. We visit Psychonauts headquarters and some of the surrounding area, but there's little-to-no significance to anything that happens outside of a character's head. That's the biggest failing of Psychonauts 2. It turns every character problem or conflict into an unearned, weightless one-two punch. 1. Here's a character with a problem/conflict. Better go in their head. 2. Now that you've gone in their head and gotten some context on the problem, their problem is solved. Once you pop back into the real world, any relevant connected characters will immediately walk on-screen and express that any related conflicts or problems are also solved. It's impossible to shake the feeling that nothing happens in Psychonauts 2, despite a lot of very plot-heavy stuff going on. The gameplay has its quirks and rough edges, but frankly it's the story, characters, humor, and world design that we're here for. And much of it succeeds, despite its flaws. It's just sad to consider that the original Psychonauts' summer camp adventure felt like 10 times the high-flying spy adventure than we got when we actually went to the spy headquaters and met a ton of other spies embroiled in a big spy conflict. Psychonauts 2 ultimately spreads itself a bit too thin, sometimes in the wrong places. But again, it stands to be emphasized: Psychonauts 2 could have twice this many flaws and half as many strengths while still being twice the game that any AAA studio has put out in the last 10 years.</span>",0,0

270,Psychonauts 2,"Feb  1, 2022",10,"<span class=""blurb blurb_expanded"">This game blew my mind in the best ways. Psychonauts 2 uses awesome (and sometimes groovy) visuals and music together with compelling storytelling to craft a fantastic game.
<br/>
<br/>The mental disorders on display feel well-researched and realistic. It reminds me of Branden Sanderson's Stormlight Archive novel series in terms of the realism of mental illness portrayed. The narrative feels like a Saturday morning cartoon, with just enough maturity spice to take it to the next level, while not being overbearing. I loved learning more about the Aquatos and the history of the Psychonauts. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, even though I mostly guessed how the final act was going to go.
<br/>
<br/>Initially, I thought that ""I'm an adult, I don't have time for all of these collectibles,"" but after playing for a few hours I found that I enjoyed simply existing in the game's world. Enough so, that I decided to commit the time to 100% the game. It did help that I was covid-positive, so I had more free-time than normal. During the collect-a-thon there was one bag tag to collect, relating to a shark, that was a PITA, but I'm not going to be salty and take off review points for that.
<br/>
<br/>I did have some minor technical problems the first time I loaded the game, but hardly ever after that. Sometimes when reappearing out of the fast-travel pipes the game stuttered, but to be fair my system is far from high-tier at this point (specs are about 6 years old). During many, many, many, visually and technically complicated sections the game ran beautifully despite my older system.
<br/>
<br/>Overall, the game was a joy to play and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves platformer games like Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, A Hat In Time, and, of course, Psychonauts 1. Even if you aren't familiar with these types of games and you love a good story and music, I would still recommend trying this one.
<br/>
<br/>I don't understand the zero scores being put forward by people. Gripes are fine and all, but give a score reflective of your overall experience. Half of those zero ratings should be more like six or seven out of 10. I'm giving a 10 because my gripes don't add up to one point.
